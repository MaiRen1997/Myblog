So today I want to talk to you about something that has been at the core of my existence for the past years:freedom and democracy.

**the core of： ....的核心**

**existence： n.存在，实有；生存，生活，生活方式；<古>存在物，实体**

I was elected mayor of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela,in the year 2000.

**elected：**

I was reelected in the year 2004.

And then in the year 2008, when I was running for higher office,I was banned to run for office.

Because we were going to win.

At that time, we started a movement, a nonviolent civil resistance grassroots movement that went all over Venezuela and worked with people all around the country to build a network that could face off the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro.

**nonviolent**

**grassroot**

- **基层**

In the year 2013, Maduro was elected.

He stole an election.

- **n.女用披肩，女用长围巾；丝绸圣带，长绸带；长袍**
- **v.偷窃，盗窃；剽窃，窃取（观点）；悄悄地移动（steal 的过去式）**

And in January of 2014, we called for protest.

Tens of thousands of people went to the streets.

And that took me to prison.

I spent the next seven years in imprisonment, four of them in solitary confinement in a military prison.

The history of my country, Venezuela, is one, like many other Latin American countries, African countries, one of military rule, exile, imprisonment and politics.

So I had read a lot about what it meant to be in prison.

I read the usual suspects, I read about Mandela, I read about Gandhi,I read about my [role] model, Martin Luther King.

But I also read a lot about the experience of Venezuelans, including my great grandfather, who had been a political prisoner for years and died in exile.

Everything that they had to say was relevant to their own condition, but they all spoke about the importance of having a routine.

So I had my own routine since day one, February 18 of 2014.

My routine was simple.

I would do three things every day.

I would pray to take care of my soul.

I would read, write, to do something with my mind.

And I would do exercise.

I did those three things with Spartan discipline every day.

If I did them, I would feel that I was winning the day.

But there was one thing that I would think about every single day: why I was in prison.

And in fact, this is something that I'm sure happens to all prisoners, political prisoners or not.

That's what prison, in a way, is made for.

So every day I thought about what freedom and democracy meant.

And it was there in a cell, two by two, in solitary confinement that I really got to understand what freedom was.

And it became clear to me that freedom is not about one thing.

In fact, freedom is about the possibility of doing many things.

So the possibility to speak out, to express your mind.

It's the possibility to move around in your country.

It's the possibility to assemble with whomever you want to assemble, to pray to whomever you want to pray, to own property.

And all of those things were taken away from me and from millions of Venezuelans.

And it also became very clear to me that freedom and democracy were two sides of a coin.

Were interdependent.

You cannot have freedom without democracy.

You cannot have democracy if people are not free.

So that took me to think about the state of democracy.

In fact, next month, in November, we're going to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 35 years.

Back then, I was in grad school.

It was the '90s.

And I remember the excitement that was everywhere about spreading democracy, spreading freedom, human rights, all over the place.

I remember my teachers going to different countries with students.

But when we look back 35 years ago and we fast forward, things didn't really come out the way it was expected.

Only 10 years ago, 42 percent of the world's population was living under autocratic rule.

That was 3.1 billion people.

That's around the same time I was sent to prison.

Today, 72 percent of the global population is living under some sort of autocratic rule.

So let's think about this.

This is 5.7 billion people in the world that don't have the rights that most people in this room have.

They can't speak freely, they can't move freely, they can't pray freely, they can't own property.

5.7 billion people in the world.

After seven years of imprisonment, I was able to escape prison and went into exile.

Exile is another form of imprisonment.

At the beginning, it was tough.

But then I started to meet other people like myself, who had been leading protests in their countries, who had been political prisoners, who were in exile.

And we were very different in any way we could think about: our skin color, our religion, our languages, the story of our families, the history of our countries.

We were very different.

But when we spoke about what it meant to fight for freedom and to confront autocracies, I was with my buddies.

It was the same people, the same movement.

So we decided to create an alliance of democracy defenders and freedom fighters.

So alongside with Garry Kasparov, from Russia, and an incredible woman from Iran, Masih Alinejad, we decided to create an alliance of freedom fighters and democracy defenders.

And that's how we created the World Liberty Congress, which is an alliance of hundreds of leaders, many of them you have seen their work in Hong Kong, in Russia, in Belarus, in Uganda, in Zimbabwe, in Afghanistan, in Cambodia, Nicaragua, Cuba,
in many countries.

And we decided to work together, to come together with a single purpose:  to stop autocracy and to bring democracy to our countries.

But it became very clear to us  that we were not only facing our local autocrat, we were also facing a network of autocrats,
an axis of autocrats.

And this is something that might not be obvious to many people.

But in fact, autocrats work together.

They support each other.

In many ways: diplomatically, financially, militarily, through their kleptocratic networks.

And this is not an ideological alliance.

It has nothing to do with ideology.

Right, left, conservative, liberals, nothing to do with that.

It has to do with power, money and a common enemy: democracy.

So that's why you have the nationalists from Russia, the theocrats from Iran, the communists from China, working together under a similar alliance.

So if autocrats are working together and the world is coming to a point where 72 percent of the world's population is under autocracy, it's time to think about why should you care about this?

Why should everybody, anybody care about this?

Why should someone who’s living in the United States or in Europe or in a functioning democracy care about this?

Well, if you care about climate change, if you care about gender equality, if you care about women's rights, if you care about human rights, if you care about corruption, if you care about migration, you need to be concerned about the rise of autocracy and the need for democracy.

30 percent of the CO2 emissions come from China and Russia alone.

80 percent of the world’s poverty comes from autocratic countries.

90 percent of the forced migration, and we from Venezuela can speak about this, has at its root cause autocracy.

So we need to care about this.

And what can be done?

What can be done about this?

Well, I believe that we are now at a moment where we need to make a tipping point of the engagement of people around the world to create a movement towards freedom and democracy.

Think about the climate change movement 20, 30, 40 years ago.

It was not mainstream.

It was there, but it was not mainstream.

But then what happened?

Researchers, governments, policymakers, activists, artists, school teachers, students, children, everybody came together under the same cause.

Because I remember during the 1980s, '90s, you would look up to the sky and you would think that there was an ozone hole in the sky that was going to destroy.

So the threat was very clear.

People came together, policy came together, and now it's mainstream.

Things are being done.

I believe we are at that point with respect to democracy and freedom.

If that trend continues, today 72 percent, if that trend continues, maybe in the next 25 years, in 2050, the entire world would be autocratic.

And that is less than a generation ago.

So we must take action.

What can we do?

Well, the first thing I believe is to assume that we need to take the offensive.

Stop legitimizing autocrats.

Autocrats today are comfortable.

They do business with governments, with businesses.

We need to think of smart sanctions, of ways to make them accountable for the violations of human rights.

Second, there needs to be a support for pro-democracy and freedom movements.

In the United States, that is the most actively philanthropic society in the world, only two percent of philanthropy goes to democracy-related issues.

Only two percent.

And a fraction of a fraction of that two percent goes to promote democracy outside the US.

It's not a priority.

So supporting pro-democracy movements, supporting the people that want to be free, should be a priority for all.

And I mean, let me give you some examples.

Technology.

Access to internet, to free and uncensored internet.

Think of the potential transformational capacity to give people all over the world access to internet.

Let me give you another example.

Using new technologies like Bitcoin to promote and support the potential of these movements.

We are doing this already.

In the case of Venezuela, we supported more than 80,000 medical doctors and nurses using Stablecoins and Bitcoins
because under autocracies you are under a financial apartheid.

Give opportunities for training.

Give opportunities for these movements to be part of a global conversation.

And finally, we need to build a global movement.

There is not one person, one organization, one government, that can do this by themselves.

Similar to climate change.

We need to think of this challenge as a network.

We need to create nodes of network, nodes of network that activate all over the place.

We need to activate anyone with the things that they can do.

Musicians should think about singing for freedom.

Artists, intellectuals, researchers, activists, governments.

Everybody can create their own node with a similar goal, which is freedom and democracy.

When I was in solitary confinement, I had a window, and I could see through the crack of that window that there was a tree,
and in that tree there was a hawk.

And I contemplated that animal for hours and hours and hours.

I only think that you contemplate an animal that long if you're in biology or you're in prison.

And one day, a guard told me, because I was always telling the guards about the hawk, he said, You know, the hawk is injured, went through barbed wire, and he’s injured.”

And I said, Bring it to me.

And to my surprise, they brought it to me.

Maybe because they thought it was going to die.

I fed that hawk.

And that's the hawk in my cell.

That's a drawing I made of the prison I was [in], of that tree and of the hawk.

And then one day, after a couple of months,  they came to my cell,  they threw a blanket on the hawk, they took it away.

Of course it affected me.

But less than a day after, that hawk was in the same tree.

And it reassured me that it doesn't matter how low you are, how low percentage possibilities you have to succeed, there is always possibility to do so.

So I came out and being in exile, I met a tattoo artist, that put me a tattoo of Venezuela on my leg, so I now have that eagle here, and I have it always with me.

(Applause)
As a reminder, as a reminder that we can always rise up to all of the challenges.

So I ask all of you to stand up, to speak out, to do something about our freedom.

This is our time.

Think of 25 years, and let's give our children a free world with human rights, democracy and respect for all.

Thank you very much, thank you very much.

(Cheers and applause)

Thank you.

(Cheers and applause continue)

Helen Walters: Thank you, thank you, Leo.

Audience: Venezuela libre!

Leopoldo Lopez: Venezuela libre, hermano, Venezuela libre.

HW: OK, Leo, I wanted to ask you a few questions, and actually Venezuela is one of them.

So there were elections in July, Maduro says he won the election, observers says he did not.

But what are you hearing?

What is the situation in Venezuela right now?

LL: Well, so let me explain this very briefly.

The case of Venezuela has been an electoral autocracy.

So we've gone to elections for years.

And we've been developing the ways in which we can know exactly the results.

On July 28, there was an election, we had a candidate, Maria Corina Machado, she was disqualified the same way I was disqualified years ago.

So we had another candidate, Edmundo González.

He was unknown three months before the election, but he became known by everybody.

And on the 28th of July, he won with 70 percent of the vote.

The decision of Maduro was to steal the election.

But we were able to prove with elements of every single voting machine, that we actually won.

Maduro decided to have a repression all over the country.

We went to the election with 300 political prisoners.

Now there are maybe 2,500 political prisoners.

I wake up every day to get a message from someone from my movement who has been taken to prison, That's the situation now.

But I can assure you that we will be free.

Because one thing is to think that you are a majority, and a very different one is to know.

Everybody knows that we are a huge majority, and that will not be sustainable for Maduro because we will never surrender.
And we will be free.

(Cheers and applause)

HW: OK, so we were just chatting backstage and you mentioned that today is a very special day, and I want to bring up a photo.

And I wonder if you can tell us what today is for you.

LL: Well, today is the fourth anniversary of me meeting my family.

This is my family, that’s my wife, Lilian, more than my half.

You know, people say my second half.

No, no, it's just three quarters of who I am, my beautiful wife, Lilian.

And these are my three kids, Manuela, who is now 15, Leo, who is 11 and Federica, who is one.

And I had not seen them for almost two years.

I had not seen my kids and my wife.

And that’s the day, exactly four years ago, after I escaped, I met them back in Spain.

So it's an important day for us.

And I’m very grateful that Lilian is the woman who’s the mother of my kids. 

Because she was an incredible mother while I was away, and she was an incredible advocate for the freedom of all political prisoners when I was in prison.

HW: Leo, you’re an icon.

Thank you, Leo Lopez.

LL: Thank you very much.

所以今天我想和你们谈谈
过去几年我存在的核心问题：
自由和民主。  2000年，
我当选委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯市长
。

2004年，我再次当选。
2008年，
当我竞选更高职位时，
我被禁止竞选公职。
因为我们要赢。
当时，我们发起了一场运动，
一场非暴力的公民抵抗草根
运动，遍布委内瑞拉各地，与全国各地的
人们一起

建立一个可以对抗
尼古拉斯·马杜罗独裁统治的网络。
2013年，马杜罗当选。
他窃取了一次选举。
2014年1月，
我们呼吁抗议。
数万人
走上街头。
这让我进了监狱。
接下来的七年里，我
在监狱里度过，其中
四年被单独监禁
在军事监狱里。
我国委内瑞拉的历史，
像许多其他拉美
国家、非洲国家一样，是
一部军事统治、
流亡、监禁和政治的历史。
所以我读了很多
关于监狱意味着什么的文章。
我读到了常见的嫌疑人，
我读到了曼德拉，我读到了甘地，
我读到了我的[榜样]
马丁·路德·金。
但我也读到了很多
关于委内瑞拉人的经历，
包括我的曾祖父，
他多年来一直是政治犯

，并在流亡中去世。
他们所说的一切都
与他们自己的情况有关，
但他们都谈到了
有规律的重要性。
所以从第一天，即 2014 年 2 月 18 日起，我就有了自己的日常安排。

我的日常安排很简单。
我每天会做三件事。
我会祈祷照顾我的灵魂。
我会读书、写作，
用我的头脑做一些事情。
我会做运动。
我
每天都以斯巴达式的纪律做这三件事。
如果我做到了，我会觉得
我赢了这一天。
但我每天都会想一件事
：
为什么我会进监狱。
事实上，
我确信这会发生在所有囚犯身上，
无论是否是政治犯。
从某种意义上说，这就是监狱的存在目的。
所以我每天都在思考什么
是自由和民主。
正是在牢房里，两个两个的
单独监禁中，
我才真正明白了
什么是自由。
我清楚地意识到
，自由不是一件事。
事实上，自由意味着
做很多事情的可能性。
所以可以说出来，
表达你的想法。
这是
在您的国家/地区四处走动的可能性。
这是
与任何你想聚集的人聚集、
向任何你想祈祷的人祈祷、
拥有财产的可能性。
所有这些东西都
从我和数百万委内瑞拉人身上被夺走了。
我也非常清楚，
自由和民主
是硬币的两个方面。
是相互依存的。
没有民主就不可能有自由。

如果人们不自由，就不可能有民主。
这让我开始思考
民主的状况。
事实上，下个月，也
就是 11 月，
我们将庆祝

柏林墙倒塌 35 周年，即
35 周年。
那时，我正在读研究生。
那是 90 年代。
我记得到处
都是
关于传播民主、
自由和人权的兴奋
。
我记得我的老师

和学生一起去不同的国家。
但当我们回顾 35
年前并快进时，
事情并没有真正
按照预期发展。
仅10年前，
世界42%的人口
还生活在独裁统治之下。
那是31亿人。
大约在同一时间
我被送进监狱。
如今，全球 72% 的人口
生活在
某种独裁统治之下。
那么让我们考虑一下这个问题。
世界上有 57 亿人
没有像
在座的大多数人那样享有权利。
他们不能自由说话，
不能自由行动，
不能自由祈祷，
不能拥有财产。
世界上有 57 亿人。
经过七年的监禁，
我得以越狱
并流亡国外。
流亡是监禁的另一种形式。
一开始，这很艰难。
但后来我开始遇到
像我一样的其他人，
他们一直在自己的国家领导抗议活动
，
他们曾经是政治犯，
他们正在流亡。
我们
在任何方面都非常不同：
我们的肤色、我们的宗教、
我们的语言、
我们家庭的故事、
我们国家的历史。
我们非常不同。
但当我们
谈论争取自由
和对抗独裁意味着什么时，
我和我的朋友们在一起。
都是同样的人，同样的运动。
因此，我们决定建立
民主捍卫者
和自由斗士联盟。
因此，我们决定与来自俄罗斯的加里·卡斯帕罗夫（Garry Kasparov）

和来自伊朗的一位不可思议的女性马西赫·
阿利内贾德（Masih Alinejad）一起
建立一个
自由斗士
和民主捍卫者联盟。
这就是我们创建
世界自由大会的方式，
这是一个由
数百名领导人组成的联盟，其中
许多人你都
在香港、俄罗斯、白俄罗斯、
乌干达、津巴布韦、阿富汗、
柬埔寨、尼加拉瓜看到过他们的工作 ，古巴，
在许多国家。
我们决定共同努力，

为了一个单一的目标走到一起：
制止独裁
，为我们的国家带来民主。
但我们非常清楚，
我们不仅
面临着当地的独裁者，
我们还面临着
一个独裁者网络，
一个独裁者轴心。
这
对很多人来说可能并不明显。
但事实上，独裁者们是在一起工作的。
他们互相支持。
在许多方面：外交上、
金融上、军事上、
通过他们的盗贼网络。
这不是一个意识形态联盟。
这与意识形态无关。
右派、左派、保守派、自由派，
与此无关。
它与权力、金钱
和共同的敌人：
民主有关。
这就是为什么
来自俄罗斯的民族主义者、
来自伊朗的神权主义者、
来自中国的共产党人
在类似的联盟下共同努力。
因此，如果独裁者们齐心协力，
而世界正走向
72% 的世界
人口处于独裁统治之下，
那么是时候考虑一下为什么
要关心这个了？
为什么每个人、
任何人都应该关心这个？
为什么生活
在美国、欧洲
或正常民主国家的人应该
关心这个？
好吧，如果你关心气候变化，
如果你关心性别平等，
如果你关心妇女权利，
如果你关心人权，
如果你关心腐败，
如果你关心移民，
你就需要关心
人口增长 专制
和民主的需要。 仅中国和俄罗斯就有
30% 的二氧化碳排放量
。
世界上80%的贫困
来自专制国家。
90%的强迫移民，
我们委内瑞拉人
可以谈论这一点，
其根源是独裁统治。
所以我们需要关心这一点。
可以做什么？
对此我们能做些什么呢？
嗯，我相信，我们
现在正处于一个
需要全世界
人民参与的转折点，

以发起一场
走向自由和民主的运动。
想想 20、30、40 年前的气候变化运动
。
这不是主流。
它确实存在，但不是主流。
但后来发生了什么？
研究人员、政府、
政策制定者、活动家、
艺术家、学校教师、学生、
儿童，每个人都
在同一个目标下聚集在一起。
因为我记得在 20 世纪 80 年代、90 年代，
你抬头仰望天空
，你会认为
天空中存在一个
即将毁灭的臭氧空洞。
所以威胁是非常明显的。
人们走到一起，
政策走到一起，
现在它已成为主流。
事情正在做。
我相信我们已经到了
民主和自由的地步。
如果这个趋势继续下去，
今天72%，如果这个趋势继续下去，
也许在未来25年，2050年，
整个世界都将是专制的。
这还不到一代人的时间。
所以我们必须采取行动。
我们能做什么？
嗯，我相信的第一件事是
假设我们
需要采取进攻。
停止使独裁者合法化。
今天的独裁者很舒服。
他们与
政府、企业做生意。
我们需要考虑明智的制裁，
想办法让他们
对侵犯人权的行为负责。
其次，需要
支持民主
和自由运动。
在美国这个世界上
慈善最活跃的
社会，
只有百分之二的慈善事业
用于与民主相关的问题。
只有百分之二。 这百分之二
的一小部分

用于促进美国以外的民主。
这不是一个优先事项。
因此，支持民主运动、
支持
想要自由的人们
应该是所有人的首要任务。
我的意思是，让我举一些例子。
技术。
访问互联网，免费
且未经审查的互联网。
想想

让世界各地的人们都能
访问互联网的潜在变革能力。
让我再举一个例子。
使用比特币等新技术
来促进和支持
这些运动的潜力。
我们已经在这样做了。
就委内瑞拉而言，
我们使用稳定币和比特币支持了超过 80,000 名
医生和护士，

因为在独裁统治下，
你处于金融种族隔离之下。
给予培训机会。
为这些运动提供
参与全球对话的机会。
最后，我们需要发起
一场全球运动。
没有一个人、
一个组织、一个政府
能够独自做到这一点。
与气候变化类似。
我们需要将这一
挑战视为一个网络。
我们需要创建网络节点，在各处
激活的网络节点
。
我们需要
用他们能做的事情来激励每个人。
音乐家应该
考虑为自由而歌唱。
艺术家、知识分子、研究人员、
活动家、政府。
每个人都可以创建自己的节点，
有着相似的目标，
那就是自由和民主。
我关小号的时候
有一扇窗户，
从窗户缝里我可以看到
有一棵树，
树上有一只鹰。
我对那只动物思考了
几个小时、几个小时、几个小时。
我认为只有

当你从事生物学或在监狱里时，你才会对动物思考那么久。
有一天，一名警卫告诉我，
因为我总是向
警卫讲述鹰的事，
他说：“你知道，鹰受伤了，
穿过铁丝网，
他受伤了。”
我说：“把它拿给我。”
令我惊讶的是，他们把它拿给我，
也许是因为

我喂了那只鹰，

这是我画的。



几个月后的一天，
他们来到我的牢房，给
鹰盖上了一条毯子，当然，
他们把它拿走了。

但不到一天后，
那只鹰就在同一棵树上，
这让我放心，
无论你的水平有多低，成功的
可能性有多低
，
总是有可能做到的。
所以我出来了，在流亡中，
我遇到了一位纹身艺术家，他
在我的腿上纹了一个委内瑞拉的纹身，
所以我现在有那只鹰，
我一直带着它
（掌声）
作为提醒。
提醒我们，我们总是能够
应对所有的挑战，
所以我请求大家站起来，
为我们的自由做点什么。
一个
拥有人权、
民主和尊重所有人的自由世界。
非常感谢，非常感谢。
（欢呼和掌声）
谢谢。
（欢呼声和掌声继续）
Helen Walters：谢谢你，谢谢你，Leo。
观众：自由委内瑞拉！
莱奥波尔多·洛佩兹：自由委内瑞拉，
hermano，自由委内瑞拉。
HW：好的，Leo，我
想问你几个问题，
实际上委内瑞拉就是其中之一。
因此，七月举行了选举，
马杜罗说他赢得了选举，
观察家说他没有。
但你听到什么？
目前委内瑞拉局势如何？
LL：好吧，让我
简单地解释一下。
委内瑞拉的例子
是一个选举专制国家。
所以我们已经参加选举很多年了。
我们一直在开发
能够准确了解结果的方法。
7 月 28 日举行了一次选举，
我们有一位候选人，玛丽亚·科里娜·马查多 (Maria Corina Machado)，
她被取消了资格，就像
我几年前被取消资格一样。
所以我们有另一位候选人，
埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯。
大选前三个月，他还默默无闻，
但后来却家喻户晓。
7 月 28 日，
他以 70% 的选票获胜。
马杜罗的决定
是窃取选举。
但我们能够
用每台投票机的元素来证明

我们确实赢了。
马杜罗决定在
全国范围内进行镇压。
我们
带着 300 名政治犯去参加选举。
现在大约有
2,500名政治犯。
我每天醒来都会
收到来自我的运动中的某个人的消息，

他已经被关进监狱了，
这就是现在的情况。
但我可以向你保证，我们将获得自由。
因为认为
自己是大多数是一回事，
而知道是另一回事。
每个人都知道
我们是绝大多数，
这
对马杜罗来说是不可持续的，
因为我们永远不会投降。
我们将获得自由。
（欢呼和掌声）
HW：好的，我们刚刚在后台聊天，
你提到今天
是一个非常特别的日子，
我想拿出一张照片。
我想知道您能否告诉我们
今天对您来说是什么？
LL：嗯，今天是
我与家人见面的四周年纪念日。
这是我的家人，
这是我的妻子莉莲，
不仅仅是我的一半。
你知道，人们说“我的下半场”。
不，不，这只是
我的四分之三，
我美丽的妻子莉莲。
这是我的三个孩子，
Manuela，现在 15 岁，
Leo，11 岁，Federica，1 岁。
我已经快两年没见到他们了
。
我没有见过我的孩子和妻子。
就在那一天，
整整四年前，
我逃跑后，
在西班牙遇见了他们。
所以这对我们来说是重要的一天。
我非常感激
莉莲
是我孩子们的母亲。
因为
当我不在的时候，她是一位令人难以置信的母亲；当我在监狱里时，
她是一位令人难以置信的
所有政治犯自由的倡导者
。
HW：Leo，你是一个偶像。
谢谢你，里奥·洛佩兹。
LL：非常感谢。
