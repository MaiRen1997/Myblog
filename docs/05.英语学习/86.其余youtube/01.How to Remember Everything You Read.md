in this video I'll teach you a system for remembering everything you read
study or learn I've been using the system for the last 7 years starting
from learning disease pathophysiology in medical school through to reading
research articles and learning science or reading books on productivity or
business and the reason the system works so consistently and so well is because
it breaks down that process of reading into two distinct stages the first stage
is the consumption period and the second stage is the
digestion period most people think that by
focusing on the first stage and consuming more information they'll be
able to therefore remember and apply more information so they focus on trying
to read faster or watching lectures at triple speed or binge listening to audio
books or watching hours of YouTube tutorials but that is not how learning
works and once we understand how learning does work you'll see why my
system is so effective you see when it comes to remembering and applying
information it's much less about what comes in to your brain and it's much
more about how much stays in your brain and that is what the second stage the
digestion period is all about and it's the part that is often neglected so
teach you a system for mastering both of these stages which in turn increases
your Aurora retention as well as your ability to actually use the knowledge in
the way that you need to but first we need to ask ourselves is it even
possible to remember everything you read and the short answer is no but here's
the secret trying to remember everything we read should not be the goal in the
first place and we know this because of a man who actually could remember
everything this man's name is Kim Peak and his story is so crazy that Hollywood
made an entire movie about him Kim Peak was a mega genius and his memory was
ridiculous he was able to memorize a book with such perfect recall that after
reading a book one time he would be able to write it out word for word with every
comma and full stop back to front he memorized so many maps and atlases that
he could give you driving directions between any two cities in the world and
the path that he gave you was mentally calculated to be the shortest distance
now the reason K had such supernatural abilities is because of a very rare
medical condition he had called FG syndrome he was born with macroy which
means he had a larger brain and he had no Corpus colossum which is basically
the bundle of neurons that connect both hemispheres of the brain together in
scientists believe that because he didn't have the normal pattern of
neurons his brain adapted and developed Ved new connections to compensate which
I guess gave him like superhuman memory now I want you to imagine that both you
and Kim Peak were about to sit the same exam who do you think would do better
and the answer is that it actually depends on the exam you see despite his
superhuman memory Kim Peak struggled with reasoning and problem solving which
means that if the exam was at the junior levels of schooling which often tests on
the lower levels of of learning which involve a lot of memorization and recall
then Kim Peak would definitely win but if the exam was at a higher level like
University or postgraduate where the reasoning and problem solving the higher
orders of learning are examined as a higher priority then you may actually
have the edge now for most of you listening probably using the knowledge
you have consumed to reason and problem solve is kind of the whole point of why
you're trying to read and remember in the first place which basically means
that it is not enough to remember everything which is good because for
most people that's not possible anyway but it is possible to remember
everything you need to remember in such a way that we can use that knowledge in
the way we need to and that is what the system that I'll teach you helps you to
achieve so to start using the system we have to understand that not all
information is equal in fact I break down the information that I read into
five different categories using the acronym
Pacer and it's important to be able to identify which category the information
you're reading to belongs to because for each category there are specific
targeted processes that then help you to deal with and manage that information
more effectively and when we use the wrong process for the specific category
of information it makes remembering and understanding what you read much harder
much more timec consuming and much less effective and that you're more likely to
forget what you read it also increases the chance of you entering the passive
mode of reading which is where you get to the bottom of a page and you can't
even remember what you just read so the system goes like this in the first part
where we are consuming information we want to identify which category what we
are consuming belongs to using the Pacer acronym then during stage two we digest
what we have read using the targeted process for that category which takes
the information and stores it in our long-term memory through the process
called encoding so let's go through Pacer together so that you can
accurately identify the category of information you're trying to remember
the p and Pacer stands for procedural and procedural information is
any information that tells you how something should be executed for example
this is a book that I used during medical school that taught me about how
to do a clinical examination like listen to a heartbeat or take someone's blood
pressure and a lot of the information in this book is about the correct technique
to perform the examination and some subjects and domains have a lot of
procedural information some great examples of this would be coding and
languages the targeted process for working with with and mastering this
type of procedural information is practice the key is that you want to
apply procedural information in real life as early as possible a lot of
people will spend time to read it and memorize it and write lots of notes
about it and then a week or two later they'll try to practice it but by then
it's too late we've already forgotten a lot of it and a lot of that time is just
wasted instead as soon as you take that procedural information into your brain
try to apply it and practice it as early as you can now straight away we run into
a problem with using this approach what if we're reading something and we don't
have time to practice it right now the answer is you either move on to
something else or you stop consuming anything and you wait until you have
time to practice it but you do not waste your time trying to just memor memorize
it on the spot because here is the crucial part about learning that
everyone overlooks the two stages of consuming and digesting must always be
balanced everything you consume must be digested in order for you to retain and
use it only when stage one is followed by stage two does learning actually
occur if we're reading something and we don't have time time to use the right
process like practice then most people will say oh well I don't have time right
now I'm just going to get through as much of it as I can and they spend more
time reading and reading and essentially just consuming more and more but this is
the learning equivalent of overeating they haven't had a chance to digest it
so they're just going to end up vomiting it all up again through the mental
vomiting process we call forgetting which is why for most people the amount
that they forget after reading is extremely high with some studies
suggesting that up to 90% of what is consumed is forgotten
despite hours of consuming and if we're forgetting 90% of what we read rather
than consuming more and taking time away from the digesting it actually makes
more sense to spend less time consuming and more time on the digesting and
processing this increases your retention with which therefore increases the
amount of working knowledge you're able to build so earlier I said what goes
into your brain is less important than what stays in your brain and this
principle of balancing stage one consuming with stage two digesting is
important not just for procedural information but for every other category
of PESA unfortunately stage two digesting is almost completely neglected
for the second category of in the a of Pacer which stands for
analogous analogous information is actually one of the easiest types of
information to work with and remember and apply because analogous information
is the information that is related to something you already have prior
knowledge about and even if we don't have direct prior knowledge about it it
may remind us indirectly of something that we do have knowledge about for
example let's say that we are an avid swimmer and we're learning about the
physiology of a muscle contraction when we look at that muscle contraction cycle
we might think hey that reminds me a lot about the swimming technique I use and
by connecting the new information about muscle contraction physiology with what
we already know our swimming technique we have created
an analogy and so that is analogous information and analogies can form with
any prior knowledge including knowledge within a topic itself in most fields of
study there are Concepts or patterns of Concepts and relationships that tend to
repeat and recur throughout that field you might have learned about how to
solve a particular type of problem last semester and now this semester this new
problem solving approach that you're learning for the first time reminds you
a lot of that old problem solving process and relating those two
approaches is also an analogy so when we're engaging in stage one the
consumption period of reading we want to actively be thinking about whether what
we are reading is related to something that we already have knowledge about and
once we identify it as potentially analogous information the targeted
process we want to use here is critique this is the part I said everyone misses
once we create an analogy critiquing it means we examine critically how good
that analogy actually is for example with the analogy of muscle contraction
and swimming technique critiquing that analogy means asking ourselves in what
way specifically are these two things similar or related to each other in what
ways are they different in what situation does this analogy not make
sense anymore and if there are a lot of differences or a lot of conditions and
situations where the analogy breaks apart then is there a better analogy or
can we extend or modify that analogy to make it more comprehensive and more
accurate this critiquing process massively drives up our attention and
depth of understanding of this new information and the reason this works is
because instead of new information just being new information that your brain
doesn't know what to do with we're actually extending it from what we
already know we're taking our existing Network and connecting it to the new
information straight away which is the reason why creating analogies has been
shown in studies repeatedly to be so powerful for our retention and
understanding now at this point you might be looking at the system and
thinking this seems a little forced it doesn't feel natural and you're right in
fact it's crucial that you understand that this is not natural and that's why
it works if you have no time pressure and it doesn't matter how well you learn
something then you can learn and read however you want but unfortunately what
research has shown is that there are clear biological limitations of the
human brain to how much it can consume and store into our memory in one go and
in the modern day when there is so much we have to learn it is very very easy to
exceed that biological limit and then get overwhelmed learning is extremely
complicated so to be able to learn a lot in a short amount of time reach a high
level of knowledge a lot of processes need to go right and this is why most
people will Plateau on their learning ability and after a point not really
improve for the rest of their lives for me figuring out what processes to care
about and therefore what to improve on and then how to even execute on those
correctly took me at least 7 or 8 years of almost constant experimentation and
reading of research and coaching people to see what works for them and honestly
I got lucky because 10 15 years ago a lot of the research didn't even exists
which is why to make it easier for you I've started a free Weekly Newsletter I
take everything that I've learned that helps you become a more efficient
learner the things that have the highest chance of giving you success in a short
amount of time and I packaged them in a way that you can take and Implement into
your own learning in less than 10 15 minutes if you want to sign up to the
newsletter it's completely free I'll leave a link in the description for you
now getting back to peser you might notice that the way that I've written
the a in PESA is is like this it's this kind of strange shape there the reason
is because a the analogous information can exist within as a subset of
procedural information for example you could create an analogy on a set of
instructions to make it simpler and easier for you to understand and then
later you go and practice it but analogous information also exists as a
subset within the next category of information which is the C of Paca and
this stands for conceptual if procedural information is
the how to do something then conceptual information is the what and for most
science subjects the majority of what you need to learn is conceptual
conceptual information includes facts and explanations theories and principles
relationships between Concepts and ways that that concept can be applied and in
most cases we need both the procedural and the conceptual knowledge to solve a
problem and apply our knowledge properly for example although this book goes
through how to listen to someone's heart I still need to have the conceptual
knowledge about what I'm listening to to be able to analyze that and make a
conclusion on the diagnosis so when we identify that a piece of text we're
reading is conceptual type information the process we want to use straight away
is mapping
nonlinear network based note taking such as mind mapping is an efficient way of
increasing your attention and Mastery of conceptual knowledge because conceptual
knowledge inherently exists in a network although a textbook or a lecture might
be delivered word after word in a linear format if we look at the mind and
knowledge of the person that wrote that textbook it doesn't exist in a linear
sentence by sentence structure their knowledge and expertise exists in a
highly connected network of information there is no innate sequence of
information an expert can start at any point and navigate to any other point
this is what allows an expert to do complex problem solving because they can
look at a problem understand what concepts are related and see how those
Concepts connect together to solve the problem whereas a beginner who's only
learned it at a surface level just sees individual separated Concepts and they
don't understand how they link together as a learner our job is not to remember
the sequence word for word our job is to try to recreate that network of
knowledge that the expert had and mapping is such a great technique
because it forces us to not only think about each fact and concept but also how
they connect to each other to form a bigger picture so when you are reading
and consuming take some time to get out a piece of paper or a tablet and make a
map of the things that you're learning and as you read more you add more to
your map you move things around you reorganize things as you read more you
also digest more and your map grows remember analogous information can also
exist within conceptual information so you might find Opportunities within
conceptual information to create some analogies and you might want to add
those into your map as well even if the analogy doesn't make its way into the
map it could give you an idea in terms of how you want to structure your ideas
on your map now here's that same problem again let's say you reading but you
don't have time to draw a map or maybe you don't have anything to map on while
you're reading then again we need to slow down and consume less so that
consumption and digestion can stay balanced and if you don't you'll just
end up overwhelmed again and wasting time because not only are you going to
forget a lot of what you are consuming but now you've given the future version
of you more work to do by having to go and figure out what your forgotten and
then Rec consume it again anyway now the good news is that the digesting of
procedural analogous and conceptual information is easily the most timec
consuming the E and the r of PESA are much faster and easier to deal with I
talk about e and are together because they're both very similar to each other
but pay close attention because the two are actually so similar to each other
that most people never distinguish between the two and that can lead
directly to hours of wasted time per week the E and Pacer stands for
evidence evidence type information is the information that helps make
conceptual information more concrete they're often very detailed sometimes
very technical pieces of information but they're useful because we can use these
facts or statistics or cases as examples to prove a conceptual point for example
we could understand conceptually how World War I started but
we also need to know the evidence information of date certain specific
events occurred between which specific people at which specific location to
make that concept more concrete and the key process for evidence type
information is to store and
rehearse store means that you just colle collect that information and note it
down somewhere you could add it to your conceptual map you could add it to a
second brain system using something like notion or Rome or obsidian or you can
put it onto flashcards you could even just write them down on a document
somewhere with all the other things that you are storing this should happen as
soon as you identify it so as you are consuming the information and you
identify that this piece of information is an Evidence type we go ahead and
straight away store it the rehearsing part of it comes a little later we put
aside time to do the rehearsal and rehearsing the information is the key to
improving our retention of evidence type information rehearsing means that we
think about how we will need to use this piece of information how are we going to
apply it what type of conceptual information is this an example of we
then challenge ourselves by using an applying that information in the way
that we will need to use it this means solving problems or writing detailed
answers to questions or creating explanations teaching it to other people
or maybe writing essays that use that piece of evidence as a supporting
example for a wider concept and so while we store the information while we
consume it the rehearsing happens later maybe at the end of the day or at the
end of the week but do not waste time while you are cons assuming trying to
just memorize and read and reread and writing copious notes on that piece of
information otherwise you are not going to have enough time for the PA and C the
first three types of information which is what forms the foundation of
knowledge that the evidence type needs to build off of in the first place now
evidence type information is very similar to the final type which is the r
of PESA and this stands for reference type information reference
information is the easiest to deal with it is all of the Nitty Gritty very
specific detailed bits of information that don't really change your conceptual
understanding they're not particularly that important they're not analogous and
they're not procedural but for whatever reason we might need to know this later
this might be something like the exact value of a mathematical con Conant or a
specific Gene involved in a particular mutation or the name of a very specific
molecule of a disease or maybe a list of attributes used to define a variable for
coding and the process we use to deal with this type of information is the
same as for evidence almost it's store and rehearse the same
things the storing part exactly the same you Chuck it in a second brand and your
flash cards wherever makes sense for you but if you need to be able to record
this information from memory and you can't like refer back to your notes when
you need to use it then you probably want to use something like flash cards
because the rehearse part is a little different because reference type
information is by definition not very conceptually important anyway it's quite
hard to use this for problem solving or as part of like an extended discussion
or answer the way we're probably going to use this information is just Direct
fact recoil which is why something like flash cards using a space repetition
active recoil strategy like an app like ankey is going to be the best way to
handle reference type information so as you're reading and you're thinking hey
this might be a reference type information you dump it into your
flashcards and you put aside like 30 minutes every day or whatever to just go
through your flash cards to do your rehearsal but please again
absolutely do not waste time while you're reading trying to just read and
reread and write notes and just memorize this information at the time you need to
use that time for the first three which forms the bulk of your knowledge as I
said earlier there are a lot of things that need to go right to be able to
learn a lot of information in a short period of time and wasting time on
trying to memorize reference information while you are reading it instead of
spending that time on the first three types is one of the worst offenders and
as soon as you get into that mind frame of reading something and then rereading
it again trying to get it into your head you can say goodbye to your learning
efficiency so now you know the five types of information for you to try to
identify as you consume in stage one and the appropriate targeted process that
will help you to digest that information in stage two and the key to be able to
retain a lot and have a good high level of knowledge for what you have consumed
is to keep that stage one and stage two balanced however when it comes to
learning efficiently this just scratches the surface in fact if you look at this
map of learning that outlines the major processes that you need to be a
consistently High performing efficient learner what we talked about today is
like barely a few percent of it so if you want to start unpacking what those
other processes look like without having to dedicate
a decade of your life to uh learning about it like I did then make sure to

watching and I will see you in the next one

在这个视频里，我会教你一个系统， 用来记住你读过、
学习过或学过的所有东西。 过去 7 年来，我一直在使用这个系统，
从医学院学习疾病病理生理学， 到 …阅读
研究文章、学习科学， 或者阅读关于生产力或
商业的书籍。这个系统之所以 如此有效，是因为
它把阅读过程分解 成了两个不同的阶段。第一阶段
是消化 期，第二阶段是
吸收 期。大多数人认为，
专注于第一阶段， 吸收更多的信息，就能
记住并运用 更多的信息。所以他们会努力提高
阅读速度，或者以 三倍速度看讲座，或者狂听有声
读物，或者看几个小时的 YouTube 教程，但学习并不是这样
进行的。一旦我们理解了 学习是如何运作的，你就会明白为什么我的
系统如此有效。 说到记忆和应用
信息，重要的不是 进入大脑的信息，而是有多少信息
留在大脑里。 这就是第二阶段，也就是
消化期，也是 经常被忽视的部分。所以
教你 掌握 这两个阶段的系统，这反过来会增加
你的极光记忆力，以及你以
你需要的方式实际运用知识的能力，但首先我们 需要问自己，是否有
可能记住你读过的一切， 简短的回答是否定的，但这里有一个
秘诀，试图记住 我们读过的一切不应该是首要的目标，
我们知道这一点，因为有 一个人实际上可以记住
一切，这个人的名字叫金皮克， 他的故事太疯狂了，好莱坞
为他拍了一部完整的电影金皮克 是一个超级天才，他的记忆力
惊人，他能够 完美地记住一本书，
读完一本书后，他就能 一字不差地把它写出来，连
逗号和句号都从前到后，他 记住了如此多的地图和地图集，
他可以告诉你 世界上任何两个城市之间的驾车路线，
他给你的路径是经过 心算的最短距离，
现在 K 拥有这种超自然 能力的原因是他患有一种非常罕见的
疾病，叫做 FG 综合症，他出生时患有巨脑症，这
意味着他有一个更大的大脑， 他 没有Corpus colossum，Corpus colossum基本上是
连接大脑两个半球的神经元束。
科学家认为，因为他 没有正常的
神经元模式，他的大脑适应并发展了 新的连接来弥补，
我想这给了他超人的记忆力。 现在，我想让你想象一下，你
和Kim Peak即将参加同一场 考试，你认为谁会做得更好？
答案是，这实际上 取决于你所看到的考试，尽管
Kim Peak拥有超人的记忆力，但他在 推理和解决问题方面却很吃力，这
意味着，如果考试是在初级 教育阶段，通常会测试
较低层次的学习，这 需要大量的记忆和回忆，
那么Kim Peak肯定会赢。但 如果考试是在更高层次，比如
大学或研究生， 推理和解决问题，这些更高
层次的学习会被 优先考虑，那么你现在可能实际上已经
占了上风，对于你们大多数人来说， 可能 …利用
你所学到的知识来推理和 解决问题，这才是
你一开始试图阅读和记忆的全部原因， 这基本上意味着
记住 所有内容是不够的。 这很好，因为对
大多数人来说这是不可能的， 但我们可以记住
所有需要记住的东西，这样 我们就可以以我们需要的方式运用这些知识，
这就是 我将要教你的系统帮助你
实现的目标。所以要开始使用这个系统，我们 必须明白，并非所有
信息都是平等的。事实上，我把 我读到的信息分成
五个不同的类别，用首 字母缩略词
Pacer来表示。能够 识别
你正在阅读的信息属于哪个类别非常重要，因为 每个类别都有特定的
目标流程，可以帮助你
更有效地处理和管理这些信息。当我们对 特定类别的信息使用错误的流程时，
它会使你记住和 理解你所读的内容变得更加困难，
更加耗时， 效率也更低，你更容易
忘记你读过的内容，这也增加了 你进入被动
阅读模式的机会，也就是当你读到 一页的底部时，你
甚至不记得你刚刚读了什么。所以， 在系统的第一部分，当
我们消化信息时，我们 想要识别我们所
消化的信息属于哪个类别。 使用 Pacer 缩写，然后在第二阶段，我们会
使用 …针对 该类别的目标流程来消化所读内容，该流程会获取
信息并通过称为编码的过程将其存储在我们的 长期记忆中，
因此，让
-
-
-
我们一起学习 Pacer，以便您可以准确地识别您想要记住的信息类别。p 和 Pacer 代表程序性，程序性信息是任何告诉您如何执行某件事的信息，例如，这是我在医学院期间使用的一本书，它教我如何
进行临床检查，例如听 心跳或测量某人的
血压，本书中的许多信息都与
执行检查的正确技术有关，并且某些 学科和领域包含大量
程序性信息，一些很好的 例子是编码和
语言 …， 处理和掌握此类
程序性信息的目标流程是 练习，关键在于您要
尽早将程序性信息应用于现实生活中，许多
人会花时间阅读和 记忆它，并写下大量
关于它的笔记，然后一两周后 他们会尝试练习，但那时已经
太晚了，我们已经忘记了 很多，很多时间都被
浪费了。相反，一旦你把这些 程序性信息记入大脑，就
尝试尽早应用和练习， 现在 …我们直接
使用这种方法会遇到一个问题， 如果我们正在阅读一些东西，但我们
现在没有时间练习， 答案是你要么转到
别的东西，要么停止学习， 等到 …有
时间再练习，但你不会浪费 时间试图立即记住
它，因为这是 学习的关键部分，
每个人都忽略了 学习和消化的两个阶段，这两个阶段必须始终保持
平衡，你学习的一切都必须被 消化，这样你才能保留和
使用它，只有当第一阶段之后是 第二阶段时，学习才会真正
发生，如果我们正在阅读一些东西，但 没有时间使用正确的
过程，比如练习，那么大多数人 会说，哦，好吧，我现在没有时间，
我只是想尽可能 多地完成它，他们花费 我们花更多
时间阅读，本质上 就是在消耗越来越多的知识，但这
相当于在学习中暴饮暴食， 他们还没有机会消化，
所以最终会 通过
我们称之为遗忘的精神呕吐过程再次将其全部吐出。这 就是为什么大多数人在
阅读后忘记的内容 非常多的原因。一些研究
表明，尽管我们阅读了几个小时，但高达 90% 的内容还是会被遗忘。
如果 …我们 忘记了 90% 的阅读内容，而
不是消耗更多时间进行消化，那么花更少的时间阅读，花更多的
时间进行消化和
处理会更有意义。这会提高你的记忆力，从而 增加
你能够积累的工作知识的数量。所以， 我之前说过，
进入大脑的内容不如留在大脑中的内容重要。
平衡第一阶段的消耗与 第二阶段的消化之间的原则
不仅对程序性 信息很重要，对 PESA 的所有其他类别都很重要。
不幸的是，第二阶段的 消化几乎完全被
第二类所忽视。在 Pacer 的 a 中， 它代表了
类比。 类比信息 实际上是最容易
处理、记忆 和应用的信息类型之一，因为类比信息
是 …与 你已经掌握的先验
知识相关的信息，即使我们 没有直接的先验知识，它也
可能间接地让我们想起我们已知的知识。
例如，假设我们是一名 游泳爱好者，正在学习
肌肉收缩的生理学。当 我们观察肌肉收缩周期时，
我们可能会想，这让我想起了 我使用的游泳技术。
通过 …将 肌肉收缩生理学的新信息与
我们已知的游泳技术联系起来， 我们就创建了
一个类比。所以，类比 信息和类比可以与
任何先验知识（包括 主题本身的知识）形成。在大多数
研究领域中，概念或 概念模式以及关系往往会在
整个领域中重复出现。 你可能在上个学期学习了如何
解决特定类型的问题， 而这个学期你第一次学习的这种新的
问题解决方法会让 你 …想起
很多旧的解决问题的 过程，将这两种方法联系起来
也是一种 类比，所以当 我们处于阅读的第一阶段，也就是
消化阶段时，我们要 积极 …思考
我们所读的内容是否与 我们已知的知识相关。
一旦我们将其识别为潜在的 类比信息，
我们在这里要使用的目标过程就是批判。 这就是我说的，
一旦我们创建了一个类比，每个人都会忽略的部分。批判 意味着我们要批判性地审视
这个类比到底有多好，例如， 肌肉收缩
和游泳技术的类比。批判这个 类比意味着要问自己，
这两个事物具体在哪些方面 相似或相互关联？
它们在哪些方面不同？在什么 情况下，这个类比
不再有意义？如果存在很多 差异，或者在很多条件和
情况下，类比 不再适用，那么是否有更好的类比？
我们是否可以扩展或修改这个类比， 使其更全面、更
准确？这个批判过程 极大地提升了我们
对新信息的关注和理解深度。 它之所以有效，是
因为新信息不仅仅是 你的大脑
不知道如何处理的新信息，我们 实际上是在扩展它。
我们正在利用我们现有的 网络，并将其与新
信息直接联系起来，这就是 为什么
研究反复证明，类比 对我们的记忆和
理解如此有效。现在，你 可能会看着这个系统，
觉得这有点牵强， 感觉不自然，你是对的，
事实上，你必须明白 这不是自然的，这就是为什么
它有效的原因。如果你没有时间压力，无论 你学得多好，
你都可以随心所欲地学习和阅读。 但不幸的是，
研究表明，人类大脑在一次性处理和存储信息方面存在 明显的生物学限制。
-
在现代， 我们要学习的东西太多了，很容易
超过这个生物学限制，然后不堪 重负。学习是极其
复杂的，所以要想 在短时间内学到很多东西，达到
高水平的知识，很多过程都 需要正确进行。这就是为什么大多数
人的学习能力会停滞不前，在 某个时间点之后，
他们的余生都不会真正提高。在 我看来 为了找出需要关注的流程，
从而找出需要改进的地方， 以及如何正确执行这些流程，
我花了至少7到8年的时间， 几乎不断地进行实验、
阅读研究资料，并指导人们 找到对他们有效的方法。说实话，
我很幸运，因为10到15年前， 很多研究甚至都不存在。
为了方便大家， 我创办了一份免费的每周简报。我
把我学到的所有能 帮助你成为更高效
学习者的知识，那些最有 可能在短时间内让你取得成功的知识，
都整理成一种 方式，方便大家在10到15分钟内掌握并运用到
自己的学习中。 如果你想订阅
简报，它是完全免费的。我会 在说明中为你留一个链接。
现在回到问题，你可能会 注意到，我
在PESA中写a的方式是这样的，它的 形状很奇怪，原因
是a，类比信息 可以作为程序信息的子集存在于其中，
例如，你 可以在a上创建一个类比。 一组
指令，使 你更容易理解，
然后你去练习它，但 类似的信息也存在
于下一类 信息中，即Paca的C，
它代表概念。 如果程序性信息是
关于如何做某事，那么概念性信息就是关于什么。 对于 …大多数
科学学科来说， 你需要学习的大部分内容是概念性的。
概念性信息包括事实 和解释、理论和原理、
概念之间的关系以及 应用概念的方式。在
大多数情况下，我们需要程序性 和概念性知识来解决
问题并正确运用我们的知识。 例如，虽然这本书讲的是
如何倾听某人的心声，但 我仍然需要掌握
关于我正在听的内容的概念性知识，以便 能够分析它并得出
诊断结论。因此，当我们 确定我们正在阅读的一段文字
是概念性信息时， 我们要立即使用的过程
是 映射
基于非线性网络的笔记， 例如思维导图，这是一种
提高注意力和掌握 概念知识的有效方法，因为概念
知识本身就存在于网络中， 尽管教科书或讲座可能是
逐字逐句地讲解的。 如果我们观察
编写该教科书的人的思维和知识，就会发现 它并不存在于线性的
句子结构中，他们的 知识和专业技能存在于
高度连接的信息网络中， 没有固有的
信息序列，专家可以从任何 一点开始，导航到任何其他点，
这就是专家能够 解决复杂问题的原因，因为他们可以通过
观察问题来理解哪些 概念是相关的，并了解这些
概念如何联系在一起以解决 问题，而只
在表面层面学习的初学者只能看到 单独的概念，他们
不理解它们如何联系在一起， 作为学习者，我们的工作不是
逐字逐句地记住顺序，我们的工作是 尝试 …重建
专家所拥有的知识网络，而 映射是一种非常棒的技术，
因为它迫使我们不仅思考 每个事实和概念，还要思考
它们如何相互联系以形成 更大的图景，因此，当您阅读
和消费时，请花一些时间拿出 一张纸或一台平板电脑，绘制一张
您正在学习的内容的地图， 随着您阅读的增多，您会在地图上添加更多内容，
您会移动周围的事物 随着阅读的增多，你会重新组织事物，你
也会消化更多，你的思维导图也会不断扩大。 记住，类比信息也可能
存在于概念信息中，所以 你可能会在
概念信息中找到创建类比的机会， 你可能
也想把它们添加到你的思维导图里，即使 类比没有出现在思维导
图里，它也能让你了解 如何在思维导图上构建你的想法。
现在又出现了同样的问题， 假设你在阅读，但你
没有时间画地图，或者你在
阅读时没有任何东西可以作为地图的参考，那么我们需要 放慢速度，减少消耗，这样
消耗和消化才能保持 平衡。如果你不这样做，你
最终会再次不知所措，浪费 时间，因为你不仅会
忘记很多你正在消耗的东西， 而且你还给未来的
你增加了更多的工作要做，你必须去 弄清楚你忘记了什么，
然后 Rec 无论如何都会再次消耗它。现在的 好消息是，消化
程序性类比和概念 信息很容易成为最耗时的过程。
和 PESA 的 r 更快更容易处理。我之所以把
e 和放在一起讨论，是因为 它们非常相似，
但要密切关注，因为两者 实际上非常相似，
大多数人从不区分它们， 这
直接导致每周浪费数小时的时间。E 和 Pacer 代表证据。
证据类型信息是 帮助 …使
概念信息更加具体的信息。 它们通常非常详细，有时是
非常技术性的信息，但 它们很有用，因为我们可以使用这些
事实、统计数据或案例作为例子来 证明一个概念点。例如，
我们可以从 概念上理解第一次世界大战是如何开始的，但
我们还需要知道证据信息，例如 某些 …特定
事件发生的日期、发生在哪些特定 人群之间、在哪个特定地点，以使
该概念更加具体。 证据类型信息的关键过程
是 存储和
排练。存储意味着你只是 收集这些信息并将其记在
某个地方。你可以将其添加到你的 概念图中。你可以
使用 …诸如 Notion、Rome 或 Obsidian 之类的东西将其添加到第二个大脑系统中。或者你可以将其放在抽认卡
上。你甚至可以将 它们写在某个文档中，
与其他所有文档放在一起。 你所存储的信息应该在
你识别后立即进行，所以当你 使用这些信息时，如果你
识别出这条信息 是证据类型，我们就会
立即存储它， 它的复习部分稍后再进行，我们会留
出时间进行复习， 复习信息是
提高我们对证据类型 信息记忆的关键。复习意味着我们
思考如何使用这 条信息，如何
应用它，这是哪种概念 信息，这是一个什么类型的概念信息的例子，
然后我们挑战自己，以
我们需要的方式应用这些信息，这意味着 解决问题，或者写出详细的
答案，或者创建 解释，把它教给别人，
或者写论文，用这 条证据作为
更广泛概念的支持例子。所以，当 我们存储信息，
使用信息时，复习会在稍后进行， 可能是在一天结束的时候，或者在
一周结束的时候，但不要浪费时间，因为 你
只是试图记住、阅读、重读，并 在上面写大量的笔记。
否则你不会 有eno 呃，现在是 PA 和 C 的时间了，
前三种类型的信息构成了
证据 …类型 首先需要构建的知识基础，现在
证据类型信息 与最后一种类型非常相似，即
PESA 的 r，它代表 参考类型信息。参考
信息是最容易处理的， 它包含所有 Nitty Gritty 非常
具体的详细信息，这些信息 不会真正改变你的概念
理解，它们不是特别 重要，它们不是类似的，
也不是程序性的，但无论出于什么 原因，我们以后可能需要知道这些信息，
这可能是 数学常数的确切值，或
涉及特定突变的特定基因， 或
疾病的特定分子的名称，或 用于定义编码变量的属性列表，
我们 …处理 此类信息的过程与
证据几乎相同，它存储 和排练相同的
内容，存储部分完全相同， 你把它扔进第二个品牌和你的
抽认卡中，任何对你有意义的地方， 但如果你需要能够
从记忆中记录这些信息， 当
你需要用到笔记的时候，你无法参考它，那么你可能 需要使用类似抽认卡的东西，
因为排练部分有点 不同，因为参考类型的
信息在定义上并不是非常 重要，无论如何，
很难用它来解决问题，或者 作为扩展讨论
或回答的一部分，我们可能 使用这些信息的方式只是直接
事实反冲，这就是为什么像 抽认卡这样使用空间重复
主动反冲策略的东西，比如像ankey这样的应用程序， 将 …是
处理参考类型信息的最佳方式，所以当 你阅读的时候，你会想，嘿，
这可能是一个参考类型的 信息，你把它转储到你的
抽认卡里，你每天留出30 分钟左右的时间，只是
通过你的抽认卡进行 排练，但请再次强调，
绝对不要在阅读时浪费时间， 试图只是阅读、
重读、做笔记，并在 你需要的时候记住这些信息，用
这段时间学习前三个，这 构成了你知识的大部分，正如我
之前所说，有很多事情 需要做对 能够
在短时间内学习大量信息，却把 时间浪费在
阅读时记住参考信息上，而不是花
时间学习前三种信息，这 是最糟糕的错误之一。一旦你
养成 …了 读了一遍又
一遍试图记住的习惯， 你的学习效率就跟它说再见了。
所以现在你知道了在第一阶段学习时需要识别的五种 信息类型，以及帮助你
在 …第二阶段
消化这些信息的适当的目标过程。能够记住
很多 …信息 并对你所学习的内容有较高的知识水平的关键
是保持第一阶段和第二阶段的 平衡。然而，说到
高效学习，这只是触及了 皮毛。事实上，如果你看一下这张
学习地图，它概述了 你需要成为一个
持续 …高效 学习者的主要过程，我们今天讨论的
只是其中的百分之几。所以如果 你想开始解开
其他过程是什么样子的，而不必
像我一样花费十年时间来学习它。 那么请务必
