An old man in Miami **calls up** his son in New York and says, "Listen, your mother and I are getting **divorced**. Forty-five years of **misery** is enough."

"Dad, what are you talking about?" the son screams.

“We can't **stand** the sight of each other any longer,” he says. "<u>I'm sick of her face, and I'm sick of talking about this</u>, so call your sister in Chicago and tell her," and he **hangs up**.

Now, the son is worried. So he calls up his sister.

She says, "Like hell they’re getting divorced!" and calls her father immediately. "You’re not getting divorced! **Don't do another thing**, **the two of us** are flying home tomorrow to talk about this. Until then, don't call a lawyer, don't file a paper, DO YOU HEAR ME?” and she hangs up.

**The old man turns to his wife and says** "Okay, they’re coming for Christmas and paying their own airfares."

“This kid **dialed** 911 telling the **dispatcher** <u>he was running away from home after an argument with his mother</u>.

This officer arrived talked to the kid and went into his bedroom which was empty outside of a **deflated blowup bed**. The young man **essentially** slept on the floor.

The officer encouraged the boy to stay home. The child’s mother facing a **tough financial hardship**.

The officer left and soon returning with a bed, a television and a game system. The child was **elated** beyond words. Not all angels wear wings! Thank you officer!!!!” ❤️❤️❤️

**Is this true that many Chinese would like to get a green card in a Western country? Which countries would be the most desirable?**

It is true. **Competition** in China **is terribly fierce**. A town house of 300 square meters in China **tier 2 city** costs about 2 million USD, not mention the tier 1 cities. The middle class husband and wife both need to work to maintain an acceptable life. Competition for kids is even **harsher**. High school students need to study 12-16 hours a day and 7 days a week. Only ~3% of the high school students have chances to enter **so called** 985 university ranked in top 500 over the world.

With a green card, like me now, it takes 2 months for me to own a house in Melbourne by only me going work and my wife staying at home for baby caring. I work 30–40 hours a week while in China I often worked 60–70 hours a week with my phone is online 24*7. So why not? The Australia needs **diligent**, non-complaining workers and most of Chinese are this type. Chinese workers get what they cannot get in their home country too.

Australia, USA, Canada is still the most popular migration target and I foresee **Africa** will be next **rising star**.

However, though got what I want in Melbourne, soon I start to miss the life in China. Life in Australia is slow, **blunt**, **kinds of hollow**. People work to feed their families but **can’t see any grand future**. I wish the Australia government can have some long range plan and tell us where the whole country is going to, so that all of us can **unleash** our **passion** to be one of them. Unfortunately I didn’t see any.

In China, the target is clear, it is planned to 2050 and **mega projects** are under developing. People got the passion for their job and enjoy the **pride** of achievement. I still can’t forget my design for the China first self designed high speed train 5 years ago. It was so much fun and memorable when the train finally runs smoothly on the rail. China stands up in another **field** again.

**How big is the gap between Russia and the USA in terms of military? Don't be biased**

**<u>Let’s put it this way</u>**.

**Back in 2003**, USA (with UK) **invaded** **Iraq**. It had fairly modern **weaponry**, a large mobilized army that was prepared to face the **invasion**. USA was fighting on the other side of the world, Saudi Arabia **prohibited** the use of their territory and Turkey didn’t want to join the **coalition**, so all the **forces** were coming in from Kuwait. **Iraqis** knew exactly where Americans were coming from and had **ample** time to prepare. Americans were fighting almost 10,000 km from their home.

The war lasted six weeks and took fewer than 200 **coalition** lives, 139 Americans and 33 British **soldiers** died, **approximately** 600 were **wounded**. Saddam was removed from power and a new government installed. You can **quibble** about what happened later, the army part was done **flawlessly**.

Back in 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine too had some modern weaponry, **but was caught by surprise**. No one in Ukraine thought Russia would launch the invasion, it would be **outright** silly. Russia was fighting on their border, within 400 km of Moscow even and invaded not only through Russia, but through Belarus as well, driving hard for Kyiv. Ukraine had only about 24 hours to prepare, that’s when Ukrainian **high command** realized the Western intelligence was right.

The war is now 2.5 years old. Russian **casualties** are in **hundreds of thousands**. The **armored** **fist** of their army is no more, they’re making do with old Soviet-era **weaponry** and **barely** **trained** **recruits**. They lost **dozens of** planes, **thousands of** tanks and haven’t yet captured a single provincial capital - save for Kherson, which they lost back to Ukrainians. The few towns they managed to capture **despite** **fierce** resistance are now **smoldering** **ruins**. Ukrainian **forces** occupy a part of Russia and are **striking** **deep inside** Russia with **drones** and **saboteurs**. A private army **rebelled** and drove to Moscow, it was only stopped by the fact their commander was even stupider than he looked (and he looked very stupid).

Since the beginning of the summer Russians lost more men each day than Americans and the British lost to bring down Saddam Hussein in 6 weeks, while fighting on the other side of the world. In fact they lose about twice as many men each day these days, thanks to fierce Ukrainian offensive.

I think this showcases the differences quite well. It’s rather stark.

**Is it safe to say that China is at least 30 years ahead of India?**

The answers largely agree that China is significantly ahead of India in many areas, particularly infrastructure, economic development, and manufacturing capabilities. However, the exact timeframe and extent of China's lead are debated, with estimates ranging from 15 to 50 years. Some answers also highlight areas where India may have advantages or different priorities
