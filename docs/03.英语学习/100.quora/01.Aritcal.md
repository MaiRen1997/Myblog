An old man in Miami **calls up** his son in New York and says, "Listen, your mother and I are getting **divorced**. Forty-five years of misery is enough."

"Dad, what are you talking about?" the son screams.

“We can't **stand** the sight of each other any longer,” he says. "I'm sick of her face, and I'm sick of talking about this, so call your sister in Chicago and tell her," and he **hangs up**.

Now, the son is worried. So he calls up his sister.

She says, "Like hell they’re getting divorced!" and calls her father immediately. "You’re not getting divorced! **Don't do another thing**, **the two of us** are flying home tomorrow to talk about this. Until then, don't call a lawyer, don't file a paper, DO YOU HEAR ME?” and she hangs up.

**The old man turns to his wife and says** "Okay, they’re coming for Christmas and paying their own airfares."

**Is this true that many Chinese would like to get a green card in a Western country? Which countries would be the most desirable?**

It is true. **Competition** in China **is terribly fierce**. A town house of 300 square meters in China tier 2 city costs about 2 million USD, not mention the tier 1 cities. The middle class husband and wife both need to work to maintain an acceptable life. Competition for kids is even harsher. High school students need to study 12-16 hours a day and 7 days a week. Only ~3% of the high school students have chances to enter so called 985 university ranked in top 500 over the world.

With a green card, like me now, it takes 2 months for me to own a house in Melbourne by only me going work and my wife staying at home for baby caring. I work 30–40 hours a week while in China I often worked 60–70 hours a week with my phone is online 24*7. So why not? The Australia needs diligent, non-complaining workers and most of Chinese are this type. Chinese workers get what they cannot get in their home country too.

Australia, USA, Canada is still the most popular migration target and I foresee Africa will be next rising star.

However, though got what I want in Melbourne, soon I start to miss the life in China. Life in Australia is slow, blunt, kinds of hollow. People work to feed their families but can’t see any grand future. I wish the Australia government can have some long range plan and tell us where the whole country is going to, so that all of us can unleash our passion to be one of them. Unfortunately I didn’t see any.

In China, the target is clear, it is planned to 2050 and mega projects are under developing. People got the passion for their job and enjoy the pride of achievement. I still can’t forget my design for the China first self designed high speed train 5 years ago. It was so much fun and memorable when the train finally runs smoothly on the rail. China stands up in another field again.
