## 一般现在时

频度副词: (放在动词之前)

always > usually > often > sometimes > seledom > rarely > never

 用法

1. 表示经常性习惯性的动作或存在的状态。

   ```
   I often get up early.
   He is busy every day
   ```

2. 表示主语的特征、性格、能力、爱好等

   I like swimming.
   John works hard
   ```

3. 表示客观真理

   ```
   There are seven days in a week
   The earth moves around the sun.
   ```

### 结构

#### 主语 + 系动词be(am/is/are)  + 



```
She is beautiful.
This is my dog.
Mom is in the kitchen.
```

::: tip

be之后不再有其它动词，常跟形容词，名词或介词短语作表语

1. 否定：在be后加not

2. 疑问：把be提至主语前

   ```
   This isn’t my dog.
   Is this your dog?
   ```

:::

#### 主语+其它动词

1. 主语+动词原形

   适用于：主语为第三人称单数以外的其它人称时。

   ```
   I love you.
   I like coffee.
   ```

2. 否定：主语 + don’t+动词原形

   ```
   I don’t like coffee.
   ```

3. 疑问：在主语前加do，句末问号

   ```
   Do you like coffee?
   What do you like?
   ```

4. 一般疑问句的回答常用do的简略形式

   ```
   Yes, I do.
   No, I don’t.
   ```

   ::: tip注意

   切记：`be动词`与`行为动词`**不能**出现在同一句子中！

   - I am from China

   - I come from China

     不能说： I am come from China

   “英汉语言有差异，
   be/do不能放一起，
   仔细琢磨细分析，
   语法千万要牢记。”

   :::

#### 主语+动词第三人称单数

适用于：主语是第三人称单数时(he/she/it)

1. 一般动词在词尾加 -s

   ```
   like – likes
   run – runs
   live – lives
   work - works
   ```

2. 以辅音字母+y结尾的动词，把y变为i再加-es

   ```
   cry – cries
   fly – flies
   study – studies
   buy - buys
   ```

3. 以s, x, sh, ch, o结尾的动词，词尾加-es

   ```
   teach – teaches
   wash – washes
   fix – fixes
   ```

   ::: tip

   变换方法及读音规则类似名词变复数

   注意：

   名词两个以上时需加-s,-es;动词一般现在时态主语为第三人称单数时需加-s,-es。

   :::

4. 疑问和否定

否定和疑问类似第1)种结构的 he likes animals,

**只需把do改成does。**
**注意：加上does之后，动词一定改回原形!!!**

```
Does Linda like music?
```

```
Linda doesn’t like music.
```

**记口诀：“见助动，用原形”。**

## 现在进行时

### 结构：

am/is/are + doing(动词现在分词)

am/is/are在此为助动词，没有实际意义，帮助动词doing一起作谓语。
表示“是”时为系动词。
但不论做何种用途，主谓一致的规则不变

```
I am doing…
He/She/It is doing…
We/You/They are doing…
```

## 现在完成时

## 现在完成进行时

### 结构

**has/have + 动词过去分词(p.p.)**

过去分词形式通常与过去式一样，不规则动词需单独记忆。
has/have为助动词。
否定疑问在has/have上发生变化。

1. 动作在过去已经发生, 但对现在的影响依然存在, 而且具体发生时间不明。一旦有具体发生的时间,就必须用一般过去时

   与一般过去时的区分：

   1. 一般过去时只表示具体过去某时发生的动作, 常与以下时间状语连用： yesterday, last year, last week, 3 days ago, in 1989等。

   2. 现在完成时强调一个过去发生的动作对现在造成的`影响或结果`。常与以下时间状语连用：just(刚刚)，already(已经), yet(还,仍然), never(从不), ever(曾经)等.

      ```
      He has already left.
      I have already finished my work.
      We have already had breakfast.
      ```

2. 表示一直延续到现在的动作。这时句中常出现for, since, so far等词

   I have lived in BJ `for` 12 years.
   I have lived in BJ since 2002.
   `So far,` we haven’t seen each other

## 一般过去时

### 用法

1. 表示过去某个特定时间点的状态或动作

   ```
   I bought a dictionary yesterday.
   He was a doctor a year ago.
   ```

2. 过去某段时间内的习惯，反复发生的动作

   ```
   When he was a child, he often wet the bed.
   ```

3. 当谈到已故的人的时候

   ```
   Lu Xun was a great writer
   ```

### 结构

1. 主语 + be过去时(was, were)

   am   ->   was

   is   ->  was

   are  ->   were

   

   I/He/She/It was…

   We/You/They were

   ```
   Jimmy was ill last week.
   I was at the dentist’s yesterday
   It was cold yesterday.
   We were home yesterday.
   I was tired last night.
   ```

   **否定疑问同以前：在be上发生变化**

   Was Jimmy ill last week?

   Where were you just now?

   Was John there just now?

2. 主语 + 动词过去式(适用于：任何人称)

   1. 不规则动词的过去式需单独记忆(详见不规则动词表)

      say -> said

      do -> did

      go -> went

      come -> came

   2. 规则动词过去式

      1. 一般动词词尾加-ed

         call -> called

         answer -> answered

         finish -> finished

      2. 以e结尾的动词只加-d

         phone -> phoned

         believe -> believed

         agree -> agreed

      3. 以辅音字母+y结尾的动词, y变为i再加-ed

         cry -> cried

         try -> tried

         study -> studied

         enjoy -> enjoyed

         play -> played

      4. 以重读闭音节结尾的动词，双写最后一个辅音字母再加-ed

         stop -> stopped

         beg -> begged

         fit -> fitted

   3. 动词加-d/-ed后读音

      1. 清辅音后读[t]

         knocked/helped/asked

      2. 浊辅音和元音后读[d]

         cleaned/tried/begged

      3. [t] [d]后读[id]

         wanted/minded

   4. 否定：动词前加`didn’t`, 把`动词改回原形`。

   5. 疑问：主语前加did, `动词改回原形`, 句末问号

      Did he phone you yesterday?

      What did you say?

      What did you do yesterday?

## 过去进行时

### 用法：

表示过去某时刻或某个阶段正在进行的动作。

### 结构：

was/were + doing

She was swimming yesterday afternoon.

I was sleeping at ten last night

过去进行时尤用于when, as, while引导的时间状语从句中，用来说明主句动作发生时的背景

When I was cooking, he called

When he was crossing the street, he slipped.

While we were having dinner, the doorbell rang.

### 否定句

否定疑问在was/were上发生变化

否定在was/were 上加not

疑问句，将was/were 提前

You were not listening to me.

Were you listening to me?

Were you talking to me?

How were you feeling at that time?

Who were you talking to just now?

## 过去完成时

表示动作发生在过去某时之前，即一定强调“过去的过去

|        |                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 肯定句 | sb + had + done              |
| 否定句 | sb + had not / hadn't + done |
| 疑问句 | had + sb + done              |

   1. shall只用于第一人称(I, we).

   2. will可用于任何人称，常和主语缩写为’ll，否定缩写won’t。

   3. will/shall为情态动词，不随主语的改变而改变。其后必须用动词原形

      It’ll snow tonight.

      It won’t snow tonight.

      Will you miss me?

      I was, am and will be your friend.

2. be going to为将来时态的一种体现形式，但若表示客观的，人为无法改变的事不用此结构。
