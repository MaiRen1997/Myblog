## 一般现在时

### 用法

1. 表示经常性习惯性的动作或存在的状态。

   ```
   I often get up early.
   He is busy every day
   ```

2. 表示主语的特征、性格、能力、爱好等

   ```
   Susan is tall.
   I like swimming.
   John works hard
   ```

3. 表示客观真理

   ```
   There are seven days in a week
   The earth moves around the sun.
   ```

### 结构

#### 主语 + 系动词be(am/is/are)

```
She is beautiful.
This is my dog.
Mom is in the kitchen.
```

::: tip

be之后不再有其它动词，常跟形容词，名词或介词短语作表语

1. 否定：在be后加not

2. 疑问：把be提至主语前

   ```
   This isn’t my dog.
   Is this your dog?
   ```

:::

#### 主语+其它动词

1. 主语+动词原形

   适用于：主语为第三人称单数以外的其它人称时。

   ```
   I love you.
   I like coffee.
   ```

2. 否定：主语 + don’t+动词原形

   ```
   I don’t like coffee.
   ```

3. 疑问：在主语前加do，句末问号

   ```
   Do you like coffee?
   What do you like?
   ```

4. 一般疑问句的回答常用do的简略形式

   ```
   Yes, I do.
   No, I don’t.
   ```

   ::: tip注意

   切记：`be动词`与`行为动词`**不能**出现在同一句子中！

   - I am from China

   - I come from China

     不能说： I am come from China

   “英汉语言有差异，
   be/do不能放一起，
   仔细琢磨细分析，
   语法千万要牢记。”

   :::

#### 主语+动词第三人称单数

适用于：主语是第三人称单数时(he/she/it)

1. 一般动词在词尾加 -s

   ```
   like – likes
   run – runs
   live – lives
   work - works
   ```

2. 以辅音字母+y结尾的动词，把y变为i再加-es

   ```
   cry – cries
   fly – flies
   study – studies
   buy - buys
   ```

3. 以s, x, sh, ch, o结尾的动词，词尾加-es

   ```
   teach – teaches
   wash – washes
   fix – fixes
   ```

   ::: tip

   变换方法及读音规则类似名词变复数

   注意：

   名词两个以上时需加-s,-es;动词一般现在时态主语为第三人称单数时需加-s,-es。

   :::

4. 疑问和否定

否定和疑问类似第1)种结构的 he likes animals,

**只需把do改成does。**
**注意：加上does之后，动词一定改回原形!!!**

```
Does Linda like music?
```

```
Linda doesn’t like music.
```

**记口诀：“见助动，用原形”。**

## have的用法

1. have基本意思为“拥有”“具有”，第三人称单数has

   ```
   I have a sister and a brother.
   He has a car
   ```

   表示这层含义时，其疑问和否定形式有两种:

   1. 把have作为一般动词，否定疑问通过do, does来体现(美式)

      ```
      Do you have a brother?
      I don’t have a brother
      ```

   2. 把have作为助动词，即提前变为疑问，后加not变为否定。（英）

      ```
      Have you a brother?
      I haven’t a brother.
      ```

2. have表示“患病”，用法完全同用法1

   ```
   Jimmy has a bad cold.
   ```

   ```
   Does he have a bad cold?
   Has he a bad cold?
   ```

   ```
   He doesn’t have a bad cold.
   He hasn’t a bad cold.
   ```

3. have可表示“吃，喝，玩，做”等常见的动作

   这时have为实义动词，否定疑问需借助于助动词do的某种形式

   ```
   have breakfast
   have lunch
   have dinner
   have a party
   ```

## 一般过去时

### 用法

1. 表示过去某个特定时间点的状态或动作

   ```
   I bought a dictionary yesterday.
   He was a doctor a year ago.
   ```

2. 过去某段时间内的习惯，反复发生的动作

   ```
   When he was a child, he often wet the bed.
   ```

3. 当谈到已故的人的时候

   ```
   Lu Xun was a great writer
   ```

### 结构

1. 主语 + be过去时(was, were)

   am   ->   was
   is   ->  was
   are  ->   were

   I/He/She/It was…
   We/You/They were

   ```
   Jimmy was ill last week.
   I was at the dentist’s yesterday
   It was cold yesterday.
   We were home yesterday.
   I was tired last night.
   ```

   **否定疑问同以前：在be上发生变化**

   Was Jimmy ill last week?

   Where were you just now?

   Was John there just now?

2. 主语 + 动词过去式(适用于：任何人称)

   1. 不规则动词的过去式需单独记忆(详见不规则动词表)

      say -> said
      do -> did
      go -> went
      come -> came

   2. 规则动词过去式

      1. 一般动词词尾加-ed

         call -> called
         answer -> answered
         finish -> finished

      2. 以e结尾的动词只加-d

         phone -> phoned
         believe -> believed
         agree -> agreed

      3. 以辅音字母+y结尾的动词, y变为i再加-ed

         cry -> cried
         try -> tried
         study -> studied
         enjoy -> enjoyed
         play -> played
