## 反意疑问句

反意疑问句由两部分组成：前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开。
陈述句肯定则问句否定，陈述句否定则问句肯定。

即：**`前肯后否前否后肯`**。

::: tip 注意

1. 问句主语需与主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词。

2. 前后助动词，时态须保持一致

   ```
   You have lived here for many years,haven’t you?
   ```

   ```
   He won’t be late,will he?
   ```

   ```
   You are tired, aren’t you?
   ```

   ```
   It isn’t going to rain tomorrow, is it?
   ```

   ```
   He went out, didn’t he?
   ```

   ```

   ```

## 直接引语VS间接引语

直接引语间接引语都是宾语。

直接引语即一字不差地引用别人的话，需放在引号（单引号）内；

间接引语则是用自己的话转述别人的话，不用引号，而以宾语从句的形式出现。

直接引语变间接引语时须注意人称和时态的变化：

1. 人称的变化：按照中文作相应改变。

2. 时态的变化：

   1. 若当即转述别人的话，动词（如say, tell等）用一般现在时，则直接引语中的时态不用作任何改变放在间接引语中。
