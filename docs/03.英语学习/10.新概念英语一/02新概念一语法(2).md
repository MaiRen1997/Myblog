## 反意疑问句

反意疑问句由两部分组成：前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开。
陈述句肯定则问句否定，陈述句否定则问句肯定。

即：**`前肯后否前否后肯`**。

::: tip 注意

1. 问句主语需与主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词。

2. 前后助动词，时态须保持一致

   ```
   You have lived here for many years,haven’t you?
   ```

   ```
   He won’t be late,will he?
   ```

   ```
   You are tired, aren’t you?
   ```

   ```
   It isn’t going to rain tomorrow, is it?
   ```

   ```
   He went out, didn’t he?
   ```

   ```
   He hasn't left yet, has he?
   ```

   ```
   You have been here for a long time, haven't you?
   ```

## 直接引语VS间接引语

直接引语间接引语都是宾语。

直接引语即一字不差地引用别人的话，需放在引号（单引号）内；

间接引语则是用自己的话转述别人的话，不用引号，而以宾语从句的形式出现。

直接引语变间接引语时须注意人称和时态的变化：

1. 人称的变化：按照中文作相应改变。

2. 时态的变化：

   1. 若当即转述别人的话，动词（如say, tell等）用一般现在时，则直接引语中的时态不用作任何改变放在间接引语中。

      He says: ‘I am busy.’

      He says that `he is` busy.

      

      Mr. Jones says: ‘I have just finished my work.’

      Mr. Jones says that `he has` just finished `his` work.

      Sally says: ‘I’m sitting under the tree.’

      Sally says that she is sitting under the tree.

      

      Sara says: ‘I broke that plate.’

   | 直接引语   | 间接引语     |
   | ---------- | ------------ |
   | 一般现在时 | 一般过去时   |
   | 一般过去时 | 过去完成时   |
   | 现在进行时 | 过去进行时   |

## neither(也不)与so(也)

### 用法

即：Neither + 助动词 + 主语.

So + 助动词 + 主语（助动词形式与上一句保持一致）

I can’t swim.
— Neither can I.

 I haven’t got any small change.
— Neither have I.

I didn’t see the movie.
— Neither did I.

I haven’t been to Europe.
— Neither have I.
— Neither has she.

I can swim.
— So can I.

I have got some small change.
— So have I.

— I saw the movie.
— So did I.

I have been to Europe.
— So have I.
— So has she.

## 不定代词

| every      | no      | any      | some      |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| everyone   | no one  | anyone   | someone   |
| everybody  | no body | anybody  | somebody  |
| everything | nothing | anything | something |
| everywhere | nowhere | anywhere | somewhere |

举例：

Is there anything in the water?
There is something in the water.

## 定语从句

### 定义

定语从句即一句话作定语，放在所修饰的名词或代词之后，所修饰的名词或代词称为`先行词`。
定语从句的连接词：
关系代词：

who先行词是人,从句中作主语或宾语

whom先行词是人, 从句中作宾语

which 先行词是物，从句中作主语或宾语

that 先行词是人或物，从句中作主语或宾语



The man is a teacher.

The man was here just now.

The man who was here just now is a teacher.



I know the guy.

You like the guy.

I know the guy `whom` you like.



I bought the books.

The books are on the counter.

I bought the books `which` are on the counter.



I don’t like the novel.

You are reading the novel.

I don’t like the novel `which` you are reading



Who is the man?

You are talking about the man.

Who is the man `who/whom` you are talking about?

### 定语从句的省略

1. 定语从句中关系代词作宾语时可以省略。

2. 定语从句中关系代词作主语后又有be动词时可以把关系代词和be一起省略

   This is the book (`that`) I bought yesterday.

   The man (`who is`) standing behind the counter served me.

   I am the one `who` bought the book.

## must VS have to

### 共同点：

都有“有必要，必须”之意，后都跟动词原形

### 不同点

1. must侧重主观上必须， 而have to侧重客观上必须，有强迫之意，常译为“不得不”

2. must无人称和时态的变化，have to有人称和时态变化。

3. must否定疑问在自身发生变化，have to否定疑问需借助于助动词do的某种形式。

4. mustn’t表示“一定不能”；而don’t have to表示“没有必要”，等于needn’t。

   I must study hard.

   I have to study hard.

   He has to study hard.

   I will have to study harder.

   

   Must you go now?

   Do you have to go now?

   I mustn’t go now.

   I don’t have to go now.

## Must表示推测

1. must可表示非常肯定的推测，翻译成“一定…”

   结构：must+动词原形(多用be)

2. **`否定句用can’t。`**

   He must be a doctor.

   He must be ill.

   Jane must be at least 40.

   He can’t be a doctor.

   He can’t be ill.

3. 若表示“一定在做某事”,则用： `must be doing…`

   It must be raining.

   He must be sleeping.

4. 若表示对过去的推测，`结构为：must + have done`

   You must have met him yesterday.

5. 若表示对过去的推测，当时动作在进行，则结构为：

   `must + have been doing`

   You must have been sleeping when I called you

   `否定句依然用can’t。`

   You can’t have seen me yesterday. I stayed at home all day.

   I can’t have been sleeping.

## may/might表推测

may/might表推测用法同must（对现在或将来的推测后跟动词原形，对过去的推测后跟完成形式），语气不如must强。

might在此并非may过去式，只是语气比may还要弱。

It may be a cat.

He might have been busy last night.

He may be reading.

He may have been reading.

## 条件状语从句(虚拟语气)

条件状语从句分两种：真实条件句和非真实条件句（即虚拟语气）

真实条件句结构：  

if从句: 一般现在时态

主句：一般将来时态或情态动词

**`切记：条件状语从句中不用将来时态！`**

### 主将从现

### 主情从现

If I have enough money, I will travel around the world.

If you don’t hurry up, we will be late.

如果你嫁给我，我会让你幸福(make you happy)的。

If you marry me, I will make you happy

如果你乘出租车(take a taxi)，你会赶上那班飞机的。

If you take a taxi, you will catch the plane.

## 宾语从句

### that引导的宾语从句

陈述句放在宾语从句中之前加that，that无实际意义，可省略。

You are right.  ->  I know that you are right.

### if/whether引导的宾语从句

`一般疑问句`放在宾语从句中，需在疑问句`句首加if/whether`，`改为陈述句语序`。
if/whether意为“是否”，不可省。



Are you a doctor? I want to know if you are a doctor.

Have you finished your work? I want to know if you have finished your work.

Will you go abroad? I want to know if you will go abroad.

Are you listening to me? I want to know if you are listening to me.

Do you love me?  I want to know if you love me.

Does Mary need any help?  I want to know if Mary needs any help.

Did you watch the movie last night? I want to know if you `watched` the movie last night.

### 特殊疑问词引导的宾语从句

`特殊疑问句`放在宾语从句中只需改为陈述句语序，不加别的词。
特殊疑问词不能省略

What are you talking about? I want to know what you are talking about.

Where have you been? I want to know where you have been.

When did Tom leave?  I want to know when Tom left.

How did you get here?  I want to know how you got here.

What does she like? I want to know what she likes.

Who told you that?  I want to know who told you that

### 特殊疑问词作主语，一句话不倒装

注：`特殊疑问词作主语时放在宾语从句中语序不变。`

Who took my pen?  I want to know who took my pen.

Which is yours?  I want to know which is yours.

How many people are waiting? I want to know how many people are waiting.

## 被动语态

语态是动词的一种形式，用以表示主语和谓语之间的关系。

语态分两种：主动语态和被动语态。

主动语态表示主语是谓语动词的执行者；被动语态表示主语是谓语动词的承受者。

被动语态用于不知道动作的执行者是谁或根本没必要说明动作的执行者是谁。

谓语结构：`be + 过去分词`

不同时态体现在be形式不同

### 区分

1. 一般现在时被动语态结构:

   `am/is/are + 动词过去分词`

2. 一般过去时被动语态结构:

   `was/were + 动词过去分词`

   My car `is cleaned` every week.

   Our cars `are cleaned` every week

   The house `was built` 100 years ago.

   These houses `were built` 100 years ago.

   The office `is cleaned` every day.

   The offices `are cleaned` every day

   He `is` never `invited` to a party

   They `are` never `invited` to a party.

   The office `was cleaned` yesterday.

   The offices `were cleaned` yesterday

   He `was invited` to a party yesterday

   They `were invited` to a party yesterday.

### 主动变被动

主语 + `谓语` + 宾语 （主动语态）

宾语 + `be + 过去分词` + (by + 主语)（被动语态）

I clean my car every week. -> My car is cleaned (by me) every week.

They built the house 100 years ago. -> The house was built (by them) 100 years ago.

1. 现在完成时被动语态结构:

   has/have been + 动词过去分词

2. 一般将来时被动语态结构:

   will be + 动词过去分词

   My car has been repaired.

   These cars have been repaired.

   His key has just been stolen.

   His keys have just been stolen.

   The room has been cleaned. -> These rooms have been cleaned.

   My car will be repaired tomorrow. -> The cars will be repaired tomorrow.

   The thief will be caught soon. -> The thieves will be caught soon.

   | ---------- | --------------------------- |
   | 一般现在   | `am/is/are` + done          |
   | 一般过去   | `was/were` + done           |
   | 现在进行   | `am/is/are` + `being` done  |
   | 过去进行   | `was/were` + `being` + done |
   | 现在完成时 | `has/have` + `been` + done  |
   | 过去完成时 | `had` + `been` + done       |
   | 一般将来时 | `will` + `be` + done        |
   | 过去将来时 | `would` + `be` + done       |
   |            |                             |
