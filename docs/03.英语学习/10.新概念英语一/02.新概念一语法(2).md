## 反意疑问句

反意疑问句由两部分组成：前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开。
陈述句肯定则问句否定，陈述句否定则问句肯定。

即：**`前肯后否前否后肯`**。

::: tip 注意

1. 问句主语需与主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词。

2. 前后助动词，时态须保持一致

   ```
   You have lived here for many years,haven’t you?
   ```

   ```
   He won’t be late,will he?
   ```

   ```
   You are tired, aren’t you?
   ```

   ```
   It isn’t going to rain tomorrow, is it?
   ```

   ```
   He went out, didn’t he?
   ```

   ```
   He hasn't left yet, has he?
   ```

   ```
   You have been here for a long time, haven't you?
   ```

## 直接引语VS间接引语

直接引语间接引语都是宾语。

直接引语即一字不差地引用别人的话，需放在引号（单引号）内；

间接引语则是用自己的话转述别人的话，不用引号，而以`宾语从句`的形式出现。

直接引语变间接引语时须注意人称和时态的变化：

1. 人称的变化：按照中文作相应改变。

2. 时态的变化：

   1. `若当即转述别人的话，动词（如say, tell等）用一般现在时，则直接引语中的时态不用作任何改变放在间接引语中`。

      He says: ‘I am busy.’

      He says that `he is` busy.

      

      Mr. Jones says: ‘I have just finished my work.’

      Mr. Jones says that `he has` just finished `his` work.

      Sally says: ‘I’m sitting under the tree.’

      Sally says that she is sitting under the tree.

      

      Sara says: ‘I broke that plate.’

      Sara says that she broke that plate.

   2. 若过了一段时间再转述别人的话，动词用一般过去时态（said, told等），则时态需作如下变化
   
   | 直接引语   | 间接引语     |
   | ---------- | ------------ |
   | 一般现在时 | 一般过去时   |
   | 一般过去时 | 过去完成时   |
   | 现在进行时 | 过去进行时   |
   | 一般将来时 | 过去将来时   |
   | 现在完成时 | 过去完成时   |
   | 情态动词   | 对应的过去式 |

   She said: ‘I’m hungry.’ ->She said that she was hungry.

   'I am having breakfast',he told me. -> He told me that he was having breakfast.

   He said: ‘I want to see you.’ -> He said that he wanted to see me.

   She said: ‘I’ve just made a new film.’ -> She said that she had just made a new film.

   She said: ‘I am going to retire.” -> She said that she was going to retire.

   Tom said: ‘I broke the cup.’ -> Tom said that he had broken the cup.

   Jane said to Jack: ‘I love you.” -> Jane said to Jack that she loved him.

   He said: ‘We will come back soon.’ -> He said that they would come back soon.
   
   The boss said to him: ‘You can go now.’   ->  The boss said to him that he could go now.

::: tip

宾语从句的时态需和主句保持一致：
1. 若主句用现在时态，则从句可用任何时态；

2. 若主句用过去时态，则从句必须用过去的某种时态(客观真理除外)

   I think that you are wrong.

   I think that you were wrong.

   I thought that you were wrong

:::

## have的用法

1. have基本意思为“拥有”“具有”，第三人称单数has

   ```
   I have a sister and a brother.
   He has a car
   ```

   表示这层含义时，其疑问和否定形式有两种:

   1. 把have作为一般动词，否定疑问通过do, does来体现(美式)

      ```
      Do you have a brother?
      I don’t have a brother
      ```

   2. 把have作为助动词，即提前变为疑问，后加not变为否定。（英）

      ```
      Have you a brother?
      I haven’t a brother.
      ```

2. have表示“患病”，用法完全同用法1

   ```
   Jimmy has a bad cold.
   ```

   ```
   Does he have a bad cold?
   Has he a bad cold?
   ```

   ```
   He doesn’t have a bad cold.
   He hasn’t a bad cold.
   ```

3. have可表示“吃，喝，玩，做”等常见的动作

   这时have为实义动词，否定疑问需借助于助动词do的某种形式

   ```
   have breakfast
   have lunch
   have dinner
   have a party
   ```

## neither(也不)与so(也)

### 用法

置于句首，其后用倒装。

即：Neither + 助动词 + 主语.

So + 助动词 + 主语（助动词形式与上一句保持一致）

I can’t swim.
— Neither can I.

 I haven’t got any small change.
— Neither have I.

I didn’t see the movie.
— Neither did I.

I haven’t been to Europe.
— Neither have I.
— Neither has she.

I can swim.
— So can I.

I have got some small change.
— So have I.

— I saw the movie.
— So did I.

I have been to Europe.
— So have I.
— So has she.

## 不定代词

| every      | no      | any      | some      |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| everyone   | no one  | anyone   | someone   |
| everybody  | no body | anybody  | somebody  |
| everything | nothing | anything | something |
| everywhere | nowhere | anywhere | somewhere |

举例：

Is there anything in the water?
There is something in the water.

There isn’t anything in the water.
There is nothing in the water.

## 定语从句

### 定义

定语从句即一句话作定语，放在所修饰的名词、代词或名词短语之后，所修饰的名词或代词称为`先行词`。

### 定语从句划分

分为`限定性定语从句`和`非限定性定语从句`。`非限定性定语从句用逗号与主句隔开，不能由that来引导`

### 定语从句的连接词(引导词)：

引导词指代先行词, 并一定在定语从句中以先行词的身份充当某个成分(主语, 宾语, 定语, 表语或状语)。

1. 关系代词(who, whom, whose, that, which)：

   who先行词是`人`,`从句中作主语或宾语`

   whom先行词是`人`, `从句中作宾语`

   which 先行词是`物`，`从句中作主语或宾语`

   that 先行词是`人或物`，`从句中作主语或宾语`

   whose 先行词`人或物`，`从句中作定语`

2. 关系副词(when, where, why)

   when 先行词需是`表示时间`的名词，`在从句中作时间状语`

   where 先行词需是`表示地点`的名词，`在从句中作地点状语`

   why `先行词只能是reason`，`在从句中作原因状语`

3. 介词情况

   `that/who之前不能要介词，若有介词需用which/whom`

   Who is the man `about whom` you are talking?

   I will never forget the day.       I came to Beijing on that day.

   -> I will never forget the day `when(on which) I came to Beijing.`

   The police searched the house.     He lived in the house.

   ->  The police searched the house where(in which) he lived.

4. `副词 = 介词 + which`

   I don‘t know the reason.       He is angry for that reason.

   ->  I don‘t know the reason `why(for which)` he is angry

5. 关系词省略

   | 关系词的省略问题 | 关系代词                                 | 关系副词          |
   | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
   | 限定性定语从句   | 作宾语(不能位于介词之后)或表语时可以省略 | when, why可以省略 |
   | 非限定性定语从句 | 不可省略                                 | 不可省略          |

   他还记得他第一次去上学的那一天

   He still remembers the day when he first went to school.

6. 主谓一致问题

   如果关系代词作从句主语，那么从句谓语动词的单复数需和先行词保持一致

   I like your friend who `comes`from Shandong.

   I like your friends who` come` from Shandong

7. 以下情况定语从句关系代词需用that:

   1. 先行词有形容词最高级修饰时:

      Newton was one of the greatest men that ever lived.

   2. 先行词有序数词修饰时

      This is the first movie that I have ever seen

   3. 先行词有the only, the very修饰时

      The only thing that he is interested in is eating.

      This is the very book that I am looking for

   4. 先行词为不定代词(something, anything, everything, nothing等)时

      I need to eat something that isn‘t so sweet

   5. 当先行词既含表人的名词又含表物的名词时

      The man in charge complained that the boss didn‘t send the men and money that he needed

::: tip

注：

1. 关系代词或关系副词在定语从句中已充当一定成分，因此从句中不能出现与它重复的成分

2. 定语从句需紧跟在先行词之后！

   The man who spoke to you just now is my friend.

   I can‘t answer the question that you asked

   He still remembers the day when he first went to school

:::

I like the girl.

The girl has big eyes.

->I like the girl `who has big eyes.`



I like the girl.

The girl‘s eyes are very big.

I like the girl `whose eyes are very big.`



Please pass me the book.

The book‘s cover is green.

Please pass me the book `whose cover is green`



I don‘t like the novel.

You are reading the novel.

I don‘t like the novel `which you are reading.`



That was a fault.

The fault couldn‘t be forgiven.

That was a fault `which couldn‘t be forgiven.`



Who is the man?

You are talking about the man.

Who is the man `who/whom you are talking about?`



The man is a teacher.

The man was here just now.

The man who was here just now is a teacher.

I know the guy `whom` you like.



I bought the books.

The books are on the counter.

I don’t like the novel.

You are reading the novel.

I don’t like the novel `which` you are reading



Who is the man?

You are talking about the man.

Who is the man `who/whom` you are talking about?

### 定语从句的省略

1. 定语从句中关系代词作宾语时可以省略。

2. 定语从句中关系代词作主语后又有be动词时可以把关系代词和be一起省略

   This is the book (`that`) I bought yesterday.

   The man (`who is`) standing behind the counter served me.

   I am the one `who` bought the book.

## 过去分词做定语

1. 过去分词作定语表示被动；

   单个过去分词置于所修饰词之前；

   过去分词短语置于所修饰词之后；

   a broken glass

   a glass broken by my sister

   a damaged car

   a car damaged in an accident

   

   We have an old musical instrument.

   It is called a clavichord.

   -> We have an old musical instrument `called a clavichord.`

## 现在分词做定语

1. `现在分词`作定语表示`动作在进行`；

   `动名词`作定语表示`功能`。

   单个现在分词置于所修饰词之前；

   现在分词短语置于所修饰词之后

   a `passing` boat

   a `flying` bird

   a `running` dog

   a `sleeping` baby

   a `sleeping` pill

   a `flying` bird

   a bird `flying in the sky`

## 表语从句

1. 表语从句即`一句话作表语`。和宾语从句类似，都`属于名词性从句`。

2. 表语从句和宾语从句引导词的比较

   | 由何种句子转化而来 | 陈述句        | 一般疑问句                         | 特殊疑问句 |
   | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
   | 宾语从句           | that (常省略) | whether / if (个别情况只用whether) | 特殊疑问词 |
   | 表语从句           | that (常省略) | whether                            | 特殊疑问词 |

   The fact is `(that)` I can‘t finish the job in two days.

   The question is `whether` it is true or not.

   This is not `what` I meant

## must VS have to

### 共同点：

都有“有必要，必须”之意，后都跟动词原形

### 不同点

1. must侧重主观上必须， 而have to侧重客观上必须，有强迫之意，常译为“不得不”

2. must无人称和时态的变化，have to有人称和时态变化。

3. must否定疑问在自身发生变化，have to否定疑问需借助于助动词do的某种形式。

4. mustn’t表示“一定不能”；而don’t have to表示“没有必要”，等于needn’t。

   I must study hard.

   I have to study hard.

   He has to study hard.

   I will have to study harder.

   

   Must you go now?

   Do you have to go now?

   I mustn’t go now.

   I don’t have to go now.

## Must表示推测

1. must可表示非常肯定的推测，翻译成“一定…”

   结构：must+动词原形(多用be)

2. **`否定句用can’t。`**

   He must be a doctor.

   He must be ill.

   Jane must be at least 40.

   He can’t be a doctor.

   He can’t be ill.

3. 若表示“一定在做某事”,则用： `must be doing…`

   It must be raining.

   He must be sleeping.

4. 若表示对过去的推测，`结构为：must + have done`

   You must have met him yesterday.

5. 若表示对过去的推测，当时动作在进行，则结构为：

   `must + have been doing`

   You must have been sleeping when I called you

   `否定句依然用can’t。`

   You can’t have seen me yesterday. I stayed at home all day.

   I can’t have been sleeping.

## may/might表推测

may/might表推测用法同must（对现在或将来的推测后跟动词原形，对过去的推测后跟完成形式），语气不如must强。

might在此并非may过去式，只是语气比may还要弱。

It may be a cat.

He might have been busy last night.

He may be reading.

He may have been reading.

## 条件状语从句(虚拟语气)

条件状语从句分两种：真实条件句和非真实条件句（即虚拟语气）

1. 真实条件句结构：  

   if从句: 现在时态(一般现在时，现在进行时，现在完成时)

   主句：`一般将来时`态或`情态动词`或`祈使句`

   **`切记：条件状语从句中不用将来时态！`**

   **`主将从现、主情从现、主祈从现`**

2. 非真实条件句

   1. 与现在事实相反

   2. 与过去事实相反

   3. 与未来趋势相反

      1. 与现在事实相反的非真实条件句

         | 从句谓语            | 主句谓语                       |
         | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
         | did(be动词只用were) | would/shoud/could/might   + do |

         If you `ate` more and `talked` less, we `would` both enjoy our dinner!

         If it `were` not for hope, the heart `would` break.        人为希望而活。

         If there `were` no clouds, we `should` not enjoy the sun.      吃得苦中苦，方知甜中甜

         If I `were` a bird, I `could` fly to you.

         If I `knew` the truth, I `would` tell you.

         If I `had` time, I `would` help you.

      2. 与过去事实相反的非真实条件句

         | 从句谓语 | 主句谓语                                   |
         | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
         | had done | would / should / could / might + have done |

         If I `had known` your telephone number, I `would have called` you yesterday.

         If he `had listened` to his teacher‘s advice, he `could have passed` the exam.

         If he `had been` more careful, he `would not have made` the mistake.

         If I `hadn‘t come` to Beijing, I `wouldn't have met` you.

      3. 与未来趋势相反的非真实条件句

         | 从句谓语                                             | 主句谓语                            |
         | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
         | 1)did(be用were)<br/>2)should + do<br/>3)were to + do | would / should / could / might + do |

         If we `missed` the train tomorrow, we `should wait` an hour at the station.

         If it `should rain` tomorrow, I `would not go` there.

         If the sun `were to rise` in the west, I `would lend` you the money.

If I have enough money, I will travel around the world.

If you don’t hurry up, we will be late.

If you move, I will shoot you.

If he is sleeping, don’t wake him.

If you’ve finished the housework, you can see the movie.

If winter comes, can spring be far behind?

如果你嫁给我，我会让你幸福(make you happy)的。

If you marry me, I will make you happy

如果你乘出租车(take a taxi)，你会赶上那班飞机的。

If you take a taxi, you will catch the plane.

## 宾语从句

### that引导的宾语从句

陈述句放在宾语从句中之前加that，that无实际意义，可省略。

You are right.  ->  I know `(that) you are right.`

### if/whether引导的宾语从句

`一般疑问句`放在宾语从句中，需在疑问句`句首加if/whether`，`改为陈述句语序`。
if/whether意为“是否”，不可省。



Are you a doctor? I want to know `if you are a doctor.`

Have you finished your work? I want to know `if you have finished your work.`

Will you go abroad? I want to know `if you will go abroad.`

Are you listening to me? I want to know `if you are listening to me.`

Do you love me?  I want to know `if you love me.`

Does Mary need any help?  I want to know `if Mary needs any help.`

Did you watch the movie last night? I want to know `if you watched the movie last night`.

### 特殊疑问词引导的宾语从句

`特殊疑问句`放在宾语从句中只需改为陈述句语序，不加别的词。
`特殊疑问词不能省略`

What are you talking about? I want to know `what you are talking about.`

Where have you been? I want to know `where you have been.`

When did Tom leave?  I want to know `when Tom left.`

How did you get here?  I want to know `how you got here.`

What does she like? I want to know `what she likes.`

Who told you that?  I want to know `who told you that`

### 特殊疑问词作主语，一句话不倒装

注：`特殊疑问词作主语时放在宾语从句中语序不变。`

Who took my pen?  I want to know `who took my pen.`

Which is yours?  I want to know `which is yours.`

How many people are waiting? I want to know `how many people are waiting.`

What did you say?  I don’t understand `what you said.`

Who is he?  I don’t know `who he is.`

### 只用whether不用if

1. 做介词宾语

   I worry about `whether I hurt his feelings`

2. 跟or…结构时

   she always tells me `whether my pictures are good` or not.

   I am not sure `whether I should marry John` or Peter.

## 被动语态

语态是动词的一种形式，用以表示主语和谓语之间的关系。

语态分两种：主动语态和被动语态。

主动语态表示主语是谓语动词的执行者；被动语态表示主语是谓语动词的承受者。

被动语态用于不知道动作的执行者是谁或根本没必要说明动作的执行者是谁。

谓语结构：`be + 过去分词`

不同时态体现在be形式不同

### 区分

1. 一般现在时被动语态结构:

   `am/is/are + 动词过去分词`

2. 一般过去时被动语态结构:

   `was/were + 动词过去分词`

   My car `is cleaned` every week.

   Our cars `are cleaned` every week

   The house `was built` 100 years ago.

   These houses `were built` 100 years ago.

   The office `is cleaned` every day.

   The offices `are cleaned` every day

   He `is` never `invited` to a party

   They `are` never `invited` to a party.

   The office `was cleaned` yesterday.

   The offices `were cleaned` yesterday

   He `was invited` to a party yesterday

   They `were invited` to a party yesterday.

### 主动变被动

主语 + `谓语` + 宾语 （主动语态）

宾语 + `be + 过去分词` + (by + 主语)（被动语态）

I clean my car every week. -> My car is cleaned (by me) every week.

They built the house 100 years ago. -> The house was built (by them) 100 years ago.

1. 现在完成时被动语态结构:

   has/have been + 动词过去分词

2. 一般将来时被动语态结构:

   will be + 动词过去分词

   My car has been repaired.

   These cars have been repaired.

   His key has just been stolen.

   His keys have just been stolen.

   The room has been cleaned. -> These rooms have been cleaned.

   My car will be repaired tomorrow. -> The cars will be repaired tomorrow.

   The thief will be caught soon. -> The thieves will be caught soon.

   | 时态       | 被动语态                    |
   | ---------- | --------------------------- |
   | 一般现在   | `am/is/are` + done          |
   | 一般过去   | `was/were` + done           |
   | 现在进行   | `am/is/are` + `being` done  |
   | 过去进行   | `was/were` + `being` + done |
   | 现在完成时 | `has/have` + `been` + done  |
   | 过去完成时 | `had` + `been` + done       |
   | 一般将来时 | `will` + `be` + done        |
   | 过去将来时 | `would` + `be` + done       |
   
   ### 场合
   
   1. 不知动作的执行者
   
      The temple `was built` in 1800
   
   2. 没必要指出动作的执行者
   
      The temple `is being repaired`
   
   3. 强调动作的承受者
   
      `Bruce was hit` by a car
