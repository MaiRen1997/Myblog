## 反意疑问句

反意疑问句由两部分组成：前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开。
陈述句肯定则问句否定，陈述句否定则问句肯定。

即：**`前肯后否前否后肯`**。

::: tip 注意

1. 问句主语需与主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词。

2. 前后助动词，时态须保持一致

   ```
   You have lived here for many years,haven’t you?
   ```

   ```
   He won’t be late,will he?
   ```

   ```
   You are tired, aren’t you?
   ```

   ```
   It isn’t going to rain tomorrow, is it?
   ```

   ```
   He went out, didn’t he?
   ```

   ```
   He hasn't left yet, has he?
   ```

   ```
   You have been here for a long time, haven't you?
   ```

## 直接引语VS间接引语

直接引语间接引语都是宾语。

直接引语即一字不差地引用别人的话，需放在引号（单引号）内；

间接引语则是用自己的话转述别人的话，不用引号，而以`宾语从句`的形式出现。

直接引语变间接引语时须注意人称和时态的变化：

1. 人称的变化：按照中文作相应改变。

2. 时态的变化：

   1. `若当即转述别人的话，动词（如say, tell等）用一般现在时，则直接引语中的时态不用作任何改变放在间接引语中`。

      He says: ‘I am busy.’

      He says that `he is` busy.

      

      Mr. Jones says: ‘I have just finished my work.’

      Mr. Jones says that `he has` just finished `his` work.

      Sally says: ‘I’m sitting under the tree.’

      Sally says that she is sitting under the tree.

      

      Sara says: ‘I broke that plate.’

      Sara says that she broke that plate.

   2. 若过了一段时间再转述别人的话，动词用一般过去时态（said, told等），则时态需作如下变化
   
   | 直接引语   | 间接引语     |
   | ---------- | ------------ |
   | 一般现在时 | 一般过去时   |
   | 一般过去时 | 过去完成时   |
   | 现在进行时 | 过去进行时   |
   | 一般将来时 | 过去将来时   |
   | 现在完成时 | 过去完成时   |
   | 情态动词   | 对应的过去式 |

   She said: ‘I’m hungry.’ ->She said that she was hungry.

   'I am having breakfast',he told me. -> He told me that he was having breakfast.

   He said: ‘I want to see you.’ -> He said that he wanted to see me.

   She said: ‘I’ve just made a new film.’ -> She said that she had just made a new film.

   She said: ‘I am going to retire.” -> She said that she was going to retire.

   Tom said: ‘I broke the cup.’ -> Tom said that he had broken the cup.

   Jane said to Jack: ‘I love you.” -> Jane said to Jack that she loved him.

   He said: ‘We will come back soon.’ -> He said that they would come back soon.
   
   The boss said to him: ‘You can go now.’   ->  The boss said to him that he could go now.

::: tip

宾语从句的时态需和主句保持一致：
1. 若主句用现在时态，则从句可用任何时态；

2. 若主句用过去时态，则从句必须用过去的某种时态(客观真理除外)

   I think that you are wrong.

   I think that you were wrong.

   I thought that you were wrong

:::

## have的用法

1. have基本意思为“拥有”“具有”，第三人称单数has

   ```
   I have a sister and a brother.
   He has a car
   ```

   表示这层含义时，其疑问和否定形式有两种:

   1. 把have作为一般动词，否定疑问通过do, does来体现(美式)

      ```
      Do you have a brother?
      I don’t have a brother
      ```

   2. 把have作为助动词，即提前变为疑问，后加not变为否定。（英）

      ```
      Have you a brother?
      I haven’t a brother.
      ```

2. have表示“患病”，用法完全同用法1

   ```
   Jimmy has a bad cold.
   ```

   ```
   Does he have a bad cold?
   Has he a bad cold?
   ```

   ```
   He doesn’t have a bad cold.
   He hasn’t a bad cold.
   ```

3. have可表示“吃，喝，玩，做”等常见的动作

   这时have为实义动词，否定疑问需借助于助动词do的某种形式

   ```
   have breakfast
   have lunch
   have dinner
   have a party
   ```

## neither(也不)与so(也)

### 用法

置于句首，其后用倒装。

即：Neither + 助动词 + 主语.

So + 助动词 + 主语（助动词形式与上一句保持一致）

I can’t swim.
— Neither can I.

 I haven’t got any small change.
— Neither have I.

I didn’t see the movie.
— Neither did I.

I haven’t been to Europe.
— Neither have I.
— Neither has she.

I can swim.
— So can I.

I have got some small change.
— So have I.

— I saw the movie.
— So did I.

I have been to Europe.
— So have I.
— So has she.

## 不定代词

| every      | no      | any      | some      |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| everyone   | no one  | anyone   | someone   |
| everybody  | no body | anybody  | somebody  |
| everything | nothing | anything | something |
| everywhere | nowhere | anywhere | somewhere |

举例：

Is there anything in the water?
There is something in the water.

There isn’t anything in the water.
There is nothing in the water.

## must VS have to

### 共同点：

都有“有必要，必须”之意，后都跟动词原形

### 不同点

1. must侧重主观上必须， 而have to侧重客观上必须，有强迫之意，常译为“不得不”

2. must无人称和时态的变化，have to有人称和时态变化。

3. must否定疑问在自身发生变化，have to否定疑问需借助于助动词do的某种形式。

4. mustn’t表示“一定不能”；而don’t have to表示“没有必要”，等于needn’t。

   I must study hard.

   I have to study hard.

   He has to study hard.

   I will have to study harder.

   

   Must you go now?

   Do you have to go now?

   I mustn’t go now.

   I don’t have to go now.

## Must表示推测

1. must可表示非常肯定的推测，翻译成“一定…”

   结构：must+动词原形(多用be)

2. **`否定句用can’t。`**

   He must be a doctor.

   He must be ill.

   Jane must be at least 40.

   He can’t be a doctor.

   He can’t be ill.

3. 若表示“一定在做某事”,则用： `must be doing…`

   It must be raining.

   He must be sleeping.

4. 若表示对过去的推测，`结构为：must + have done`

   You must have met him yesterday.

5. 若表示对过去的推测，当时动作在进行，则结构为：

   `must + have been doing`

   You must have been sleeping when I called you

   `否定句依然用can’t。`

   You can’t have seen me yesterday. I stayed at home all day.

   I can’t have been sleeping.

## may/might表推测

may/might表推测用法同must（对现在或将来的推测后跟动词原形，对过去的推测后跟完成形式），语气不如must强。

might在此并非may过去式，只是语气比may还要弱。

It may be a cat.

He might have been busy last night.

He may be reading.

He may have been reading.

## 被动语态

语态是动词的一种形式，用以表示主语和谓语之间的关系。

语态分两种：主动语态和被动语态。

主动语态表示主语是谓语动词的执行者；被动语态表示主语是谓语动词的承受者。

被动语态用于不知道动作的执行者是谁或根本没必要说明动作的执行者是谁。

谓语结构：`be + 过去分词`

不同时态体现在be形式不同

### 区分

1. 一般现在时被动语态结构:

   `am/is/are + 动词过去分词`

2. 一般过去时被动语态结构:

   `was/were + 动词过去分词`

   My car `is cleaned` every week.

   Our cars `are cleaned` every week

   The house `was built` 100 years ago.

   These houses `were built` 100 years ago.

   The office `is cleaned` every day.

   The offices `are cleaned` every day

   He `is` never `invited` to a party

   They `are` never `invited` to a party.

   The office `was cleaned` yesterday.

   The offices `were cleaned` yesterday

   He `was invited` to a party yesterday

   They `were invited` to a party yesterday.

### 主动变被动

主语 + `谓语` + 宾语 （主动语态）

宾语 + `be + 过去分词` + (by + 主语)（被动语态）

I clean my car every week. -> My car is cleaned (by me) every week.

They built the house 100 years ago. -> The house was built (by them) 100 years ago.

1. 现在完成时被动语态结构:

   has/have been + 动词过去分词

2. 一般将来时被动语态结构:

   will be + 动词过去分词

   My car has been repaired.

   These cars have been repaired.

   His key has just been stolen.

   His keys have just been stolen.

   The room has been cleaned. -> These rooms have been cleaned.

   My car will be repaired tomorrow. -> The cars will be repaired tomorrow.

   The thief will be caught soon. -> The thieves will be caught soon.

   | 时态       | 被动语态                    |
   | ---------- | --------------------------- |
   | 一般现在   | `am/is/are` + done          |
   | 一般过去   | `was/were` + done           |
   | 现在进行   | `am/is/are` + `being` done  |
   | 过去进行   | `was/were` + `being` + done |
   | 现在完成时 | `has/have` + `been` + done  |
   | 过去完成时 | `had` + `been` + done       |
   | 一般将来时 | `will` + `be` + done        |
   | 过去将来时 | `would` + `be` + done       |

   ### 场合

   1. 不知动作的执行者

      The temple `was built` in 1800

   2. 没必要指出动作的执行者

      The temple `is being repaired`

   3. 强调动作的承受者

      `Bruce was hit` by a car


## need的用法

### 做情态动词用：

**作为助动词(情态动词)用,无人称和时态变化，多用于疑问句和否定句**

1. need + do…现在有无必要做某事

   You needn’t hurry.

   Need you go so soon?

2. need +have done 过去有无必要做某事

   You needn’t have waited for me yesterday.

   Need you have been so angry with him?

### 实义动词

**有人称和时态变化**

need+ n./ to do

I need your help.

You don’t need to know it.    =    You needn’t know it

## 强调句

**`It is / was + 被强调部分 + that + 句子其它成分`。**

被强调部分可以是除谓语之外的任何句子成分。若被强调部分是人 that 可换为who / whom

I saw Mary around here yesterday.

->   `It was I that / who` saw Mary around here yesterday.

->   `It was Mary that / who / whom` I saw around here yesterday



I saw Mary around here yesterday.

->   `It was around here that` I saw Mary yesterday.
