## 反意疑问句

反意疑问句由两部分组成：前一部分为陈述句，后一部分为简短问句，两部分有逗号隔开。
陈述句肯定则问句否定，陈述句否定则问句肯定。

即：**`前肯后否前否后肯`**。

::: tip 注意

1. 问句主语需与主句主语一致，且问句用代词不用名词。

2. 前后助动词，时态须保持一致

   ```
   You have lived here for many years,haven’t you?
   ```

   ```
   He won’t be late,will he?
   ```

   ```
   You are tired, aren’t you?
   ```

   ```
   It isn’t going to rain tomorrow, is it?
   ```

   ```
   He went out, didn’t he?
   ```

   ```
   He hasn't left yet, has he?
   ```

   ```
   You have been here for a long time, haven't you?
   ```

## 直接引语VS间接引语

直接引语间接引语都是宾语。

直接引语即一字不差地引用别人的话，需放在引号（单引号）内；

间接引语则是用自己的话转述别人的话，不用引号，而以宾语从句的形式出现。

直接引语变间接引语时须注意人称和时态的变化：

1. 人称的变化：按照中文作相应改变。

2. 时态的变化：

   1. 若当即转述别人的话，动词（如say, tell等）用一般现在时，则直接引语中的时态不用作任何改变放在间接引语中。

      He says: ‘I am busy.’

      He says that `he is` busy.

      

      Mr. Jones says: ‘I have just finished my work.’
      
      Mr. Jones says that `he has` just finished `his` work.

## 形容词副词比较级最高级

英文中大多数形容词副词有三种形式：原级，比较级，最高级。

1. 两者进行比较时用比较级。
2. 三者或三者以上进行比较时用最高级

### 构成

1. 一般情况词尾加-er构成比较级，加-est构成最高级

   tall -> taller -> tallest

   hard -> harder -> hardest

   great -> greater -> greatest

2. 以-e结尾的词直接加-r/-st

   large -> larger -> largest

   nice -> nicer -> nicest

3. 以辅音字母加-y结尾的词，把y变为i再加-er/-est

   happy -> happier -> happiest

   easy -> easier -> easiest

4. 重读闭音节结尾的词双写最后一个辅音字母再加-er/-est

   hot -> hotter -> hottest

   big -> bigger -> biggest

### 用法

1. 比较级只用于两者之间

   构成： 比较级 + than…

   若比较的东西比较明显，than之后可以省去。

   Mary is taller than Susan.

   My hair is longer than `yours`.

   This coat is prettier.

   Today is warmer

2. 最高级用于三者以上的比较

   结构：
   the + 最高级 (+ 比较范围)：比较范围往往是介词短语或从句（如of all, in the world, in the class, I have ever seen等）

   He is the tallest in the class.

   He is the tallest I have ever seen.

   This apple is the sweetest I have ever eaten.

### 多音节形式

多音节词（通常两个音节以上）比较级最高级分别为：

more + 原级

most + 原级、

beautiful -> more beautiful -> most beautiful

expensive -> more expensive -> most expensive

famous -> more famous -> most famous	

This car is beautiful.

That one is more beautiful.

It’s the most beautiful one I have ever seen.

注：双音节以辅音字母加-y结尾的词比较级最高级仍把y变为i再加-er/-est

busy -> busier -> busiest

若表示比原来少不管单音节词多音节词都在原级前加less变比较级，加least变最高级

Susan is tall.

I am less tall.

I am the least tall in the class.

特殊形容词副词的比较级最高级

good/well –> better –> best

bad/ill –> worse –> worst

many/much – more – most
few –> fewer –> fewest
little –> less -> least

### 不出现比较级的比较

1. A is as + 原级 + as B A和B一样

2. A is not so/as + 原级 + as B A不如B

   I am as tall as Susan.

   I am not so/as tall as Susan.

3. A is not as/so + adj. + as B      =     A is less + adj. + than B

   I am not as/so tall as Susan.

   I am less tall than Susan.

   I don’t run as/so fast as Liuxiang.

   I run less fast than Liuxiang.
