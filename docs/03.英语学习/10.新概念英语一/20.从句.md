## 状语从句的省略

1. 前提

   1. 从句主语和主句主语一致
   2. 从句中需有be动词

   省略时需把从句主语和be动词一起省略

   He fell asleep when `he was` doing his homework.

   When I was surfing the net, the power was off.

   His father died when he was only three.

   He always cut class `when he` was a boy.

   When I say I love you, I mean it.

   :::tip 特例

   当从句主语是it后有be动词时，也可把it和be一起省略

   Call me when `it is` necessary

   :::

## 非限定性定语从句

### 区别

`限定性定语从句`与`先行词有不可分割的关系, 若去掉则先行词指代不明`, 整个句子不知所云；

`非限定性定语从句`仅对意义已很明确的先行词作补充说明, 若`去掉对整个句子意义没有明显影响`, 多用逗号与主句分开。

I like the baby `who is yawning`

Beijing, `which is my hometown`, is a beautiful city

I‘ll move to Melbourne, `which is the second largest city in Australia.`

### which / as 引导的

**`which / as 引导的非限定性定语从句可以修饰整个主句`**

as 多含有 “正如” 的意思, 位于主句前后均可.

which 含义没有限制, 只能用于主句后

I said nothing, `which made him more angry.`

He was a policeman in disguise, `which surprised me a lot.`

He is good at English, `as / which we all know.`

`As we all know`, he is good at English

`As I soon learnt`, he was English himself.

Anyway, `as Brain pointed out`, it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking.

`As Napoleon once pointed it out`, attack is the best method of defense.

## 定语从句

### 定义

定语从句即一句话作定语，放在所修饰的名词、代词或名词短语之后，所修饰的名词或代词称为`先行词`。

### 定语从句划分

分为`限定性定语从句`和`非限定性定语从句`。`非限定性定语从句用逗号与主句隔开，不能由that来引导`

### 定语从句的连接词(引导词)：

引导词指代先行词, 并一定在定语从句中以先行词的身份充当某个成分(主语, 宾语, 定语, 表语或状语)。

1. 关系代词(who, whom, whose, that, which)：

   who先行词是`人`,`从句中作主语或宾语`

   whom先行词是`人`, `从句中作宾语`

   which 先行词是`物`，`从句中作主语或宾语`

   that 先行词是`人或物`，`从句中作主语或宾语`

   whose 先行词`人或物`，`从句中作定语`

2. 关系副词(when, where, why)

   when 先行词需是`表示时间`的名词，`在从句中作时间状语`

   where 先行词需是`表示地点`的名词，`在从句中作地点状语`

   why `先行词只能是reason`，`在从句中作原因状语`

3. 介词情况

   `that/who之前不能要介词，若有介词需用which/whom`

   Who is the man `about whom` you are talking?

   I will never forget the day.       I came to Beijing on that day.

   -> I will never forget the day `when(on which) I came to Beijing.`

   The police searched the house.     He lived in the house.

   ->  The police searched the house where(in which) he lived.

4. `副词 = 介词 + which`

   I don‘t know the reason.       He is angry for that reason.

   ->  I don‘t know the reason `why(for which)` he is angry

5. 关系词省略

   | 关系词的省略问题 | 关系代词                                 | 关系副词          |
   | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
   | 限定性定语从句   | 作宾语(不能位于介词之后)或表语时可以省略 | when, why可以省略 |
   | 非限定性定语从句 | 不可省略                                 | 不可省略          |

   他还记得他第一次去上学的那一天

   He still remembers the day when he first went to school.

6. 主谓一致问题

   如果关系代词作从句主语，那么从句谓语动词的单复数需和先行词保持一致

   I like your friend who `comes`from Shandong.

   I like your friends who` come` from Shandong

7. 以下情况定语从句关系代词需用that:

   1. 先行词有形容词最高级修饰时:

      Newton was one of the greatest men that ever lived.

   2. 先行词有序数词修饰时

      This is the first movie that I have ever seen

   3. 先行词有the only, the very修饰时

      The only thing that he is interested in is eating.

      This is the very book that I am looking for

   4. 先行词为不定代词(something, anything, everything, nothing等)时

      I need to eat something that isn‘t so sweet

   5. 当先行词既含表人的名词又含表物的名词时

      The man in charge complained that the boss didn‘t send the men and money that he needed

::: tip

注：

1. 关系代词或关系副词在定语从句中已充当一定成分，因此从句中不能出现与它重复的成分

2. 定语从句需紧跟在先行词之后！

   The man who spoke to you just now is my friend.

   I can‘t answer the question that you asked

   He still remembers the day when he first went to school

:::

I like the girl.

The girl has big eyes.

->I like the girl `who has big eyes.`



I like the girl.

Please pass me the book.

The book‘s cover is green.

Please pass me the book `whose cover is green`

### 定语从句的省略

1. 定语从句中关系代词作宾语时可以省略。

2. 定语从句中关系代词作主语后又有be动词时可以把关系代词和be一起省略

   This is the book (`that`) I bought yesterday.

   The man (`who is`) standing behind the counter served me.

   I am the one `who` bought the book.

## 过去分词做定语

   a damaged car

   a car damaged in an accident

   

   We have an old musical instrument.

   It is called a clavichord.

   -> We have an old musical instrument `called a clavichord.`

## 现在分词做定语

1. `现在分词`作定语表示`动作在进行`；

   `动名词`作定语表示`功能`。

   单个现在分词置于所修饰词之前；

   现在分词短语置于所修饰词之后

   a `passing` boat

   a `flying` bird

   a `running` dog

   a `sleeping` baby

   a `sleeping` pill

   a `flying` bird

   a bird `flying in the sky`

## 表语从句

1. 表语从句即`一句话作表语`。和宾语从句类似，都`属于名词性从句`。

2. 表语从句和宾语从句引导词的比较

   | 由何种句子转化而来 | 陈述句        | 一般疑问句                         | 特殊疑问句 |
   | ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
   | 宾语从句           | that (常省略) | whether / if (个别情况只用whether) | 特殊疑问词 |

## 条件状语从句(虚拟语气)

条件状语从句分两种：真实条件句和非真实条件句（即虚拟语气）

1. 真实条件句结构：  

   if从句: 现在时态(一般现在时，现在进行时，现在完成时)

   主句：`一般将来时`态或`情态动词`或`祈使句`

   **`切记：条件状语从句中不用将来时态！`**

2. 非真实条件句

   1. 与现在事实相反

   2. 与过去事实相反

## 宾语从句

### that引导的宾语从句

陈述句放在宾语从句中之前加that，that无实际意义，可省略。

You are right.  ->  I know `(that) you are right.`

### if/whether引导的宾语从句

`一般疑问句`放在宾语从句中，需在疑问句`句首加if/whether`，`改为陈述句语序`。
if/whether意为“是否”，不可省。

### 特殊疑问词作主语，一句话不倒装

注：`特殊疑问词作主语时放在宾语从句中语序不变。`

Who took my pen?  I want to know `who took my pen.`

Which is yours?  I want to know `which is yours.`

How many people are waiting? I want to know `how many people are waiting.`

What did you say?  I don’t understand `what you said.`

2. 跟or…结构时

   she always tells me `whether my pictures are good` or not.

   I am not sure `whether I should marry John` or Peter.

## 同位语从句

如果一句话中两个句子成分所指内容相同，则后者称为前者的同位语。

若同位语以句子形式出现则称为同位语从句

`主语从句`, `宾语从句`, ``同位语从句``, `表语从句`统称为`名词性从句,` 它们的结构非常类似

### 同位语从句和宾语从句引导词比较

| 由何种句子转化来 | 陈述句                  | 一般疑问句                         | 特殊疑问句 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 宾语从句         | that (可省略)           | whether / if (个别情况只用whether) | 特殊疑问词 |
| 同位语从句       | that (正式文体不可省略) | whether                            | 特殊疑问词 |

同位语从句的先行词多为fact, news, idea, thought, reply, answer, remark, plan, possibility, question等。
连接词一般用that(question除外, question 用why连接)。

No one could account for `the fact that one of the boxes was extremely heavy.`

`The question whether Tom will arrive on time` is still unknown.

`The child’s question why the sky is blue` is hard to answer

| that引导的同位语从句               | that引导的定语从句                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 进一步解释前面名词的内容           | 修饰前面的名词                           |
| that仅是连接符号, 在从句中不做成份 | that是关系代词, 在从句中做主语宾语或表语 |

`The reply that he gave me` hurt my feelings.

`The reply that he couldn’t help me` hurt my feelings.

## 分词做状语

分词有形容词副词的特征，作定语或状语。

分词作状语时相当于状语从句。

现在分词表主动, 过去分词表被动。

状语从句中若主语和主句主语一致，则可换成分词作状语

状语从句换分词作状语三步曲：
1. 看从句主语和主句主语是否一致；
2. 若一致找从句谓语动词；
3. 判断主语和从句谓语关系，主动用现在分词，被动用过去分词。

If you turn to the left, you will find the station.

->    Turning to the left, you will find the station.

While I was walking to school yesterday, I met a friend.

->   Walking to school yesterday, I met a friend.

As I didn’t receive her letter, I called her up.

->  Not receiving her letter, I called her up.

> 分词的否定直接在前面加not。

When she was asked if she had any bad habit, she answered that she was a heavy smoker.

->  Asked if she had any bad habit, she answered that she was a heavy smoker

I stood there awkwardly, as I didn’t know what to say.

->   I stood there awkwardly, not knowing what to say

As I didn’t want to be seen, I hid behind a table.

->  Not wanting to be seen, I hid behind a table.

The little girl was sitting on the ground, crying.

He lay in bed, thinking about what happened in the day.

He went home, beaten black and blue all over.

### having done

现在分词的完成形式；表示此动作发生在谓语动词之前

Because he was sick of sleeping on the floor,….

->   Being sick of sleeping on the floor,…

::: tip

being分词作状语常可省略

Sick of sleeping on the floor,…

:::

### 主语一致

使用非谓语(doing; done; to do)时，一般情况下其隐含的主语应该与主句主语保持一致。

`Because it was built in 1885, it` was the oldest car `that took part (in the race)`.

-> `Built in 1885`, it was the oldest car `taking part`.

`Because she was born in 1988, she` is the youngest teacher `who works for the school`.

-> `Born in 1988`, she is the youngest teacher `working for the school`

## 主语从句

1. 若原来是陈述句, 用that引导。that在句首时不可省略

   `It` is certain `that she will succeed`.

   `That she will succeed` is certain

2. 若原来是一般疑问句，用whether / if 引导（不可省略）。句首只能用whether。从句中用陈述语序

   `It` is not known `whether / if she will come.`

   `Whether she will come` is not known

3. 若原来是特殊疑问句，用原来的特殊疑问词引导(不可省略)。从句中用陈述语序

   `It` is a mystery `how the prisoner escaped.`

   `How the prisoner escaped` is a mystery

### 主语从句和宾语从句引导词比较

| 由何种句子转化来 | 陈述句              | 一般疑问句                         | 特殊疑问句 |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 宾语从句         | that (常省略)       | whether / if (个别情况只用whether) | 特殊疑问词 |
| 主语从句         | that (句首不可省略) | whether/if(句首不用if)             | 特殊疑问词 |

A storm is coming. It is clear.

-> `It` is clear `that a storm is coming.`

-> `That a storm is coming` is clear

Does he like it? It is not known.

-> `It` is not known `whether / if he likes it.`

-> `Whether he likes it` is not known

Why did she fail the exam? It is uncertain.

-> `It` is uncertain `why she failed the exam.`

->` Why she failed the exam` is uncertain
