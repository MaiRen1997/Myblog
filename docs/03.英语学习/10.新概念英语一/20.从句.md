## 状语从句的省略

1. 前提

   1. 从句主语和主句主语一致
   2. 从句中需有be动词

   省略时需把从句主语和be动词一起省略

   He fell asleep when `he was` doing his homework.

   When I was surfing the net, the power was off.

   His father died when he was only three.

   He always cut class `when he` was a boy.

   When I say I love you, I mean it.

   :::tip 特例

   当从句主语是it后有be动词时，也可把it和be一起省略

   Call me when `it is` necessary

## 非限定性定语从句

### 区别

`限定性定语从句`与`先行词有不可分割的关系, 若去掉则先行词指代不明`, 整个句子不知所云；

`非限定性定语从句`仅对意义已很明确的先行词作补充说明, 若`去掉对整个句子意义没有明显影响`, 多用逗号与主句分开。

I like the baby `who is yawning`

Beijing, `which is my hometown`, is a beautiful city

I‘ll move to Melbourne, `which is the second largest city in Australia.`
