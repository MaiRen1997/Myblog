# Grammar Games at Home: Jeopardy

Hi, everyone!

You might be reading or listening to this *Everyday Grammar* program <u>from your living room or bedroom</u>. 

`为什么不用in 而是用from`

| 介词     | 含义                                      | 例句                                                         |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **from** | 强调**来源/起点**（你在某个地方接收信息） | *"You're listening \*from\* your living room."*              |
| **in**   | 仅表示**位置**（你在某个地方做某事）      | *"You're listening \*in\* your living room."*（语法正确，但侧重不同） |

所以，原句使用 **"from"** 是为了更准确地表达“**你从某个地方收听节目**”，而不是单纯说“你在某个地方”。

In fact, you might be even wearing **pajamas**, no matter the time of day.

If you are like us here in Washington, D.C. and many other places, health officials have asked you to stay at home for now.

And with so many people at home for long periods, people are looking for activities to keep their minds occupied. 

`上面这段话该如何翻译？`

Too much time on social media can be a problem. Even **binge-watching** movies and television shows loses its appeal after a while.

`appeal： 吸引力, 还有恳求，上诉的意思`

`吸引力的表达：appeal / Sbdeye / Attractive force / attraction`

`binge： n.狂欢作乐，大吃大喝     v.放纵，大吃大喝`

With this in mind, we will be offering ideas for games that you can play with your family or **housemates** in the coming weeks to **practice** your English.

`With this in mind`: 出于这种考虑, 考虑到这一点

will offer与will be offering 在此处的使用

| 时态                               | 含义                                 | 例句                                                       |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **will be offering**（将来进行时） | 强调**未来一段时间内持续进行的动作** | *"We **will be offering** ideas **in the coming weeks**."* |
| **will offer**（一般将来时）       | 仅表示**未来会发生某件事**           | *"We **will offer** some ideas next week."*                |

**What is Jeopardy?**

`Jeopardy`: n.危险，风险；（刑事案件中被告的）危险处境

On today’s program we will talk about Jeopardy, a favorite game of English learning classrooms.

The idea comes from the American television game show in which players give their answers in the form of a question. You may have even seen the show in your country.

In Jeopardy, players choose from **categories** and try to win money, like this:

(Player) I’ll take Countries for $100.
(Host) This Asian country is famous for its high-quality motorcycles
(Player) What is Japan?
(Host) That is correct!

Notice that the answer came in the form of a question: “What is Japan?”

You will also note the **host** read a fact in statement form. We will call those facts **clues.**

`in statement form`: 以陈述的形式

Playing Jeopardy at home is a good way to get experience forming questions in English. It also can improve your speaking and listening skills, and help expand your **vocabulary**.

Now, let’s talk about how to play the game. You will need three or more English learners – one person to serve as host and the others to play.*

There are two ways to play the game: the traditional way (with answers in question form) and the easier way, which you can find on our website at learningenglish.voanews.com.

**How to play - traditional**

Here is how to play the traditional way.

The first step is to decide who the host will be. His or her job is to gather clues for the game. The host also reads clues to the players, and keeps a record of points won.

To play the game, you will need five separate categories. For example, you might choose: Countries, Animals, Foods, Sports and Actors. For each category, choose six clues, from easy ($100) to difficult ($600).

The host will need to keep the clues on a computer screen or write or print them on a small piece of paper.

To set up the game, you will need a **board** or large piece of paper. (If using paper, put it on a wall for all the players to see.) 

On the large paper or board, make a grid like the simple design shown on our website.

Write the categories `on the left of the grid` and the money amounts `across the top`.

| 介词          | 含义                         | 适用场景                 |
| :------------ | :--------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **across**    | 强调**横向贯穿**（水平方向） | 表格的顶部、行（row）    |
| **on / down** | 强调**纵向排列**（垂直方向） | 表格的左侧、列（column） |

- 举例

  - *"Write the dates **across the top** and the names **down the left side**."*
    （日期**横向写在顶部**，名字**纵向写在左侧**。）
  - *"The numbers are listed **across the first row**."*
    （数字**横向排列在第一行**。）

-  **"on the left" vs. "across the top"**

  - **"on the left (of the grid)"** → 表示**纵向排列**（从上到下）。

  - **"across the top"** → 表示**横向排列**（从左到右）。

  - 这种对比清晰地描述了表格的结构：
    - **左侧（垂直）**：类别（categories）
    - **顶部（水平）**：金额（money amounts）

For the full directions on how to play the game, to see how to make the grid, and for links to clues that are already prepared, go to our website.
