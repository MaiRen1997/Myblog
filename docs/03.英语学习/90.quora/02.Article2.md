**What happens if you have a heart attack and don't go to the hospital?**

`A good friend of mine`, Tony, `who was 56 two years ago`, died from a `heart-attack` when he didn’t go to the hospital. `I had seen him 4 days prior`. `He was in great shape`, loved to hunt and fish, golf, bowl, and played softball `on my team`. He woke up Monday morning and called our other friend he worked with and told him he’d slept wrong and his neck and shoulder were hurting and he wasn’t coming to work. This was very `out of characte` for him. I don’t think I EVER remember him missing a day of work from being sick. Our other friend thought the same and told him, “Maybe you should go to the Dr if you’re feeling that bad.” But Tony told him he would be fine and just needed to rest.

`Throughout the day`, he did not improve, and `by 4PM`, `he was feeling even worse`. He called his daughter and asked her if she could `give him a ride to the hospital`. She also knew this was very abnormal for his character, and rushed to get him. `He got into the car`, but `passed out on the way to the ER`. `They got him in immediately`, but were never able to `revive him`. `They said he’d been having a heart attack all day long and he would likely have been fine if he’d gone in when he first felt the symptoms`

My `Mother-In-Law` (at the time) came home from work one day, she had a shower and was relaxing on the `lounge`. `She started experiencing chest pains`, her partner said “let’s go to hospital,” `she brushed it off.`

Shortly after she ate some dinner, couldn’t finish it and said she didn’t feel well, so she went and lay in her bed. Her partner soon heard her `groaning in pain`, he went into the bedroom and said again “lets go to hospital” she agreed and got in the car. It was a 15min drive to the closest hospital, 5mins into the drive she `slumped forward` in her chair and died. Her partner `freaked out` and `sped his way to hospital` `in his panic`.

As they `pulled into` the emergency bay the nurses and doctors revived her in car and `got her inside the hospital to do further testing`, unfortunately because she was 10mins without oxygen she had significant brain damage and was later removed off of life support three days later where she died again. She was 50 years old.

If she had gone to hospital as soon as she felt the first chest pains she would be alive today, if she had decided to leave just 10mins earlier she would be alive today. I learnt to never be complacent with Chest pains.
