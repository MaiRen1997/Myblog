why is it so hard to make friends as an adult or why is it so hard to keep the friends that we do have?

A year ago I made a video talking about how I don't have any friends 

and to this day I still get a lot of messages from followers 

telling me how they related to my video and they had a lot of similar experiences to me

which really made me think about why so many people have such a hard time keeping and making friends as an adult 

I think when we were younger whether that be like middle school,   high school or sometimes even College it was, 

a lot easier to make friends simply because we were around each other for long periods of time every single day 

and this creates a kind of common denominator or common environment that brings us all together

so we might be from different backgrounds we might have different interests but at the end of the day we're all stuck in this classroom 

so we're going to find things that we haven't common 

we're going to find things to talk about to make things a little bit more enjoyable 

but as adults Everything Changes

 there are many different life paths to follow

 some people focus on family, they get married, start having kids 

and others might focus on their career

whatever it may be as an adult people are more usually focused on themselves  and doing things that they want to do 

so naturally we don't have as much time to focus on friend ships and we also start to lose these common denominators that brought us together when we were kids 

and it's not even just about the lack of free time or the convenience 

I feel like when we were kids friendships were pretty innocent
and pure but as we get older there are other things that come into play like
social status personal motives or anything like that and this can make it
kind of hard to open up to people and really trust people people for example
when I was in college I thought I had a really close friend a really good friend
of mine and we had a lot of classes together we would always go and get boba
together we'd study together always hang out we had a lot of inside jokes and to
me it seemed like a really perfect friendship but the minute I graduated
she stopped responding to my texts to be honest I was really confused at the time
and I didn't really understand what was going on but then when I started to look
back on our friendship I realized that she was actually just kind of using me
to get through all the classes we had together she would always ask me for
help she would always ask to see my work but the second I was no longer useful to
her she just cut me off this experience was honestly kind of heartbreaking for
me and it made me rethink my entire outlook on adult friendships and I also
started thinking about all the other people in my life and if they would just
suddenly leave if they realized that I was no longer any use to them but why
else is it hard to make friendships as an adult I think as we get older it
becomes a little bit harder to be vulnerable with strangers and being
vulnerable is a big part of making friends we don't want to come off as too
strong when making new friends so we might wait to respond to a text message
not wanting to seem too desperate and and it's almost like we don't want them
to think that we care more about them than they care about us which is a valid
fear I think it is really hard to accept that someone we see as a best friend
might only see us as an acquaintance or just a normal friend so naturally in
order to protect ourselves we come off as a little bit more reserved but when
everyone does this it's really hard to make close relationships for me it's not
even about finding it hard to make friends right now it's also hard to keep
the friends that I did have in the past whether that's from high school or from
college after graduation people just move on with their own lives and get
super busy and they might move to different cities or even go abroad doing
their own thing and of course I'm very happy for them but it just makes it
harder to have this connection we see each other less and less and then
naturally grow apart and share less of our lives together honestly if I think
about this for too long it does make me pretty sad because it's sad to think
that the people I grew up with and shared a lot of really really important
and perfect memories with are no longer a big part of my life but I do think
this is a normal part of life some people are only going to be there in a
specific phase of your life some people grow up hard and that's totally normal
and the good thing is nothing in life is ever permanent old friendships can
always be rekindled and you can find new friends it just might take a little more
effort and time and sometimes you have to wait for the right person to show up
in your life it's all about finding the right timing and being patient so if
you're struggling with making new friends or keeping the ones that you do
have or maybe you're just feeling a little bit lonely just know that it's
totally normal and you're not alone life moves in phases and just because you
don't have any close friends right now doesn't mean you're never going to have
any close friends and the right people will show up when they're meant to we
just need to be patient and let things happen naturally these are just some of
my thoughts on why it might be hard to make friends as an adult and and let me
know what your thoughts are on this topic or you can share your stories in
the comments if you had anything similar to me happen where you thought you had a
close friend but it turned out to be something totally different so just let
me know in the comments and I'll see you guys next time bye-bye

为什么成年后交朋友这么难， 或者 …为什么维持
现有的朋友这么难？一年前，我 制作了一个视频，谈论我
没有朋友，直到今天，我仍然 得到一个 很多粉丝留言
告诉我他们与我的视频有什么关联， 他们也有很多和
我相似的经历，这让我开始 思考为什么这么多人
成年后很难交到朋友。我想当我们
无论是初中、 高中还是大学，我们
更容易交朋友， 因为我们每天都在一起呆很
长时间， 这创造了一种
共同点或共同的环境， 让我们 我们可能
来自不同的背景，可能有 不同的兴趣，但
最终我们都被困在这个 教室里，所以我们会发现
我们没有共同点，我们会 发现一些事情 谈论让事情变得
更有趣一点，但作为 成年人，一切都会改变，有很多
不同的人生道路可供选择，有些 人专注于家庭，他们结婚，
开始生孩子，而其他人可能会专注 于他们的事业 不管怎样，作为一个
成年人，人们通常更关注 自己，做自己
想做的事情，所以我们自然就没有那么 多时间专注于友谊，
我们也开始失去让 我们走到一起的这些共同点
当我们还是孩子的时候，这甚至不仅仅是 因为缺乏自由时间或
便利，我觉得当我们还是 孩子的时候，友谊是相当纯洁
和天真的，但随着我们长大， 其他因素也会发挥作用，比如
社会地位、个人动机或 诸如此类的事情，都会让我
很难向别人敞开心扉，很难 真正信任别人。比如，
我在大学的时候，我以为我有一个 非常亲密的朋友，一个非常好的朋友
，我们一起上了很多课 我们经常一起去喝奶茶，
一起学习，一起出去玩， 我们之间有很多笑话，对
我来说，这似乎是一段非常完美的 友谊，但我毕业的那一刻，
她就不再回复我的短信了，说 实话，我真的 当时
我很困惑，不太明白发生了什么， 但当我开始
回顾我们的友谊时，我意识到 她其实只是善良的 她总是利用我
来完成我们 一起上的课程，她总是向我寻求
帮助，总是要求看我的作业， 但当我对她不再有用时，
她就切断了我的联系，说实话，这种经历让她很 心碎
这让我重新思考我 对成人友谊的整个看法，我也
开始思考 我生命中的所有其他人，
如果他们意识到我 对他们不再有用，他们是否会突然离开，但为什么
这很难 我认为，随着年龄的增长，我们
越来越 …难以 向陌生人表露自己的脆弱，而表露
自己的脆弱是交朋友的一个重要部分， 我们不想
在交新朋友时表现得太强势，所以我们 可能会等到回复短信，
不想显得太绝望， 而且几乎就像我们不想让他们
觉得我们比他们更关心 我们一样，这是一种合理的
恐惧，我认为真的很难 接受一个事实： 我们视为最好的朋友的人
可能只把我们视为熟人或 普通朋友，因此，
为了保护自己，我们自然而然地会表现得 稍微保守一点，但当
每个人都这样的时候， 对我来说，建立亲密的关系真的很难，这
甚至不仅仅是现在很难交 朋友，也很难维持
过去的朋友， 无论是高中时的 或者
大学毕业后，人们 继续过着自己的生活，变得
非常忙碌，他们可能会搬到 不同的城市，甚至出国做
自己的事情，当然我 为他们感到高兴，但这只会让他们
更难 这种联系让我们见面 越来越少，然后
自然而然地疏远了彼此， 我们在一起的时间也越来越少，说实话，如果我
长时间地思考这个问题，我会感到 非常难过，因为想到那些
和我一起长大、 一起分享的人 很多非常非常重要
和完美的回忆不再是 我生命中很重要的一部分，但我认为
这是生活的一部分，有些 人只会在
你生命的特定阶段出现，有些人 成长得很艰难 这很正常
，生活中没有什么是 永恒的，旧友谊
总是可以重新点燃，你也可以找到新 朋友，这只是有可能 多花一点
时间和精力，有时你 必须等待合适的人出现
在你的生活中，关键在于找到 合适的时机并保持耐心，所以如果
你在结交新 朋友或维持现有朋友方面遇到困难
或者也许你只是感觉 有点孤独，只要知道这
完全正常，你并不孤单，生活 分阶段进行，只是因为你
现在没有任何亲密的朋友， 并不意味着你永远不会 要想拥有
亲密的朋友，合适的人 总会在合适的时间出现，我们
只需要耐心等待，让事情 自然发生，这些只是
我对为什么 成年后很难交朋友的一些想法，以及 让我
知道你对这个话题有什么想法， 或者你可以在评论中分享你的故事，
如果你也遇到过类似的事情， 你以为你有一个
亲密的朋友，但结果却 完全不同，所以请
告诉我 评论，下次见
