what do American Girls really think about marriage ?

To be honest, from my experience I would say that most of us don't want to get married at all

 but that's not to say that there aren't a lot of people here who still want to get married and of course everyone has their own opinions about marriage 

but overall I think the trend is that most Americans are not getting married or they're getting married much later in life 

first,I think it's really important to understand that our dating culture is really different 

and most people here will date purely **out of**(因为... 做某事) love and we don't really consider too much about our partner's financial status or their job or how much property they have and no there is no CAILI in America 

usually after you're married，you'll go buy a house together and combine your incomes to pay it off together 

so when we're dating,  we basically just think it's important to find someone with similar values and similar life goals but mostly we want someone that we can fall in love with,  and someone who brings joy and happiness to our day-to-day life

because if we're going to spend the rest of our life with one person it better be someone that we truly want to see every day

 so why don't American girls want to get married?

there are two main reasons and the first one is that 

it's super hard to find a really good guy here, a lot of American guys don't do any household chores.

they're not really good at taking care of the kids and they can be extremely selfish 

so for girls, after they get married they're expected to keep doing their full-time jobs and take care of the house and do all of the child care
so I can tell you from experience of watching my mom do this, it can get really really exhausting in Chinese there's the
**phrase**(词语) 重男轻女 

and I think a lot of people think that America isn't this way 

but in most places I would say it really is (this way) 

但是我认为，在美国的大多数地方，确实也会存在这种想法

and girls are expected to do a lot more than boys 

for example I have three brothers and I'm the only daughter 

so I was expected to do a lot more than them 

and before I was even 10 years old I could cook，clean， do the dishes， mow the yard， take care of the house， and take care of my younger brothers。

literally any anything needed to be do ne around the house I could do it and I was expected to do it 

but even to this day I don't even think that some of my brothers know how to do the laundry (n.待洗的衣服)

so there are a lot of things in American culture that are really unfair for women 

and in turn it's kind of given us this negative impression of marriage 

and this leads us to the second reason that American girls don't really want to get married anymore

which is because these days most girls can live a very full and happy life being totally independent 

more and more women are getting a better education

which leads them to higher paying jobs and being able to fully support themselves 

in the past，girls were expected to get married and have kids and just live as a housewife 

and if you didn't do this it was basically socially unacceptable 

and you could be ostracized from society 

but now I would say most of the girls that  I know    are living perfectly happy lives，being totally independent and they have a good group of friends and family who support them 

while they go study or work to support themselves，getting married is definitely not the main focus of their entire life

I think it's super important that girls are able to have this choice to choose what they want their future to be 

and while it may be the case that most Americans don't really want to get married

there are still plenty of Americans who do get married 

especially if you go to some smaller towns in America

where the cost of living is much lower and people can have a more relaxed lifestyle 

you'll be able to see more and more people getting married and having kids 

because they don't need to work so much or they can rely on one person's income if they have
a really good job 

so in these situations there are some women who are Housewives

and there's no real negative connotation to this word 

unless you say it like "she's just a housewife"

then it can **come off**(出现，显得) as really judgmental

那就会让人觉得你在妄加评论

most Americans don't really judge when someone says they're a housewife or a stay atome mom or something like that 

because we know how hard it is to take care of the whole house and to raise kids basically on your own 

some people might feel **jealous**(嫉妒) or they might feel like 

those women aren't living up to to their fullpotential by just being a housewife 

but those judgmental people are really just a minority 

so even though a lot of American girls are choosing not to get married recently

I would say that **deep down**(内心深处) a lot of us still do want to get married 

it's just really hard to find the right person 

I think marriage should be pretty simple and easy and really romantic as long as we have that right person but without that person 

I think it just makes life way more difficult for a lot of women 

anyway I hope this video helped you understand more about American culture and let me know in the comments

 if you share any similar thoughts or feelings or if you have any questions feel free to ask 

and I'll see you guys next time bye-bye

根据我的经验，美国女孩对婚姻的真实看法如何？
我想说的是，我们大多数人 根本不想结婚，但这
并不是说 这里没有很多人仍然想结婚
结婚了，当然每个人 对婚姻都有自己的看法，但总的来说，
我认为趋势是大多数美国人都 没有结婚，或者他们
结婚的时间很晚， 我认为
了解我们的约会文化 确实不同非常重要 这里的大多数人
纯粹是出于爱情而约会，我们 并不会过多考虑
伴侣的财务状况、工作 或拥有多少财产，而且
美国没有 Ty，通常在 你结婚后你会 一起去买房子，
然后把你们的收入结合 在一起还清，所以当我们约会的时候，我们
基本上只是认为 找到一个有着相似价值观和
相似人生目标的人很重要，但最重要的是我们想要 一个我们可以爱上的人和
一个人 他给我们的日常生活带来欢乐和幸福， 因为如果我们
要 …和 一个人共度余生，最好是我们
真正想每天见到的人，所以为什么 美国女孩不想和一个人一起度过余生呢？ 结婚
有两个主要原因，第一个 是在这里很难找到一个真正的
好男人，很多美国 男人不做任何家务，
他们不擅长照顾 孩子，而且他们 可能非常
自私，所以对于女孩来说，结婚后 她们应该继续做
自己的全职工作，照顾 房子，照顾孩子，
所以我可以根据我妈妈这样做的经验告诉你
中文 …里 有这样一个
短语，我想很多人认为 美国不是这样的，但在大多数
地方我会说确实如此， 女孩应该比男孩做更多的事情，
例如我有 三个兄弟 ，我是唯一的女儿，所以我被
期望比他们做更多的事情， 在我 10 岁之前，我就可以
干净地做饭，洗碗，割草， 照顾房子，照顾
我的弟弟 实际上， 房子周围需要做的任何事情
我都可以做，而且人们期望我 做，但即使到了今天，我
什至不认为我的一些兄弟知道 如何洗衣服，所以有
很多事情 在美国文化中，这 对女性来说确实不公平，反过来这给
我们带来了对 婚姻的负面印象，这让我们
想到了美国女孩 不再真正想结婚的第二个原因，
因为现在大多数女孩都 可以结婚。 过着非常充实和幸福的生活，
完全独立，越来越多的 女性接受了更好的教育，
这使她们能够找到更高薪的工作， 并能够完全养活
自己。过去，女孩被 期望结婚生子，
只是像一个女人一样生活。 家庭主妇，如果你 不这样做，这基本上是社会
不可接受的，你可能会被 社会排斥，但现在我想说，
我认识的大多数女孩都 过着完全独立的幸福生活
，她们有一个很好的群体 朋友和家人
在她们学习或工作的同时支持 她们养活自己结婚绝对
不是她们一生的主要焦点 我认为女孩
能够有这样的选择来选择 她们想要的未来是非常重要的
虽然 …大多数 美国人可能并不是真的想
结婚，但仍然有 很多美国人确实结婚了，
特别是如果你去 美国的一些小城镇，那里的
生活成本要低得多，人们可以结婚。 拥有 更轻松的生活方式，你
会看到越来越多的人 结婚生子，因为他们
不需要工作太多，或者 如果他们有一份非常好的工作，他们可以依靠一个人的收入，
所以在这些情况下 有一些女性是家庭主妇
，这个词并没有真正的负面含义， 除非你说得像
她只是一个家庭主妇那样，那么它可能会 显得非常具有评判性，大多数美国人
在有人说 自己是家庭主妇或家庭主妇时并不会真正做出评判。 保持原子妈妈
或类似的东西，因为我们知道 照顾 …整个
房子并基本上独自抚养孩子是多么困难， 有些人可能会感到嫉妒，
或者他们可能会觉得那些女人 没有充分发挥自己的作用
作为一名家庭主妇就有潜力，但 那些挑剔的人实际上只是
少数，所以即使最近很多 美国女孩选择不
结婚，我想说， 我们很多人内心深处仍然想
结婚，但这真的很难 找到 合适的人，我认为只要我们有合适的人，婚姻就应该
非常简单，容易，而且非常 浪漫 …，
但如果没有那个人， 我认为这只会让
很多女性的生活变得更加困难，无论如何，我 希望这个视频对您有帮助 了解
更多关于美国文化的信息， 如果您有任何
类似的想法或感受，或者 有任何疑问，请在评论中告诉我，
我们下次再见，再见
