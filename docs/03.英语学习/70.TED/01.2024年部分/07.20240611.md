I'm Yoram Youvel.

I'm a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

And when I was 14 years old, my father died.

I was sitting in class
when my mother and my grandfather knocked on the door
and asked me out to the corridor.

"Your father's very sick," my mother said.

"Your father is dead."

And then I felt it.

A crushing pain in my chest.

I can still feel a glimpse of it whenever I think of my father.

He was a doctor, a scientist, a paratrooper.

He was a young, strong, happy, healthy man.

He was my hero.

And his death broke my heart.

Do you remember the pain you felt when someone broke your heart?

When your best friend or your mother died?

Or the man you loved told you that he doesn't love you anymore.

You probably do.

But why do we feel mental pain at all?

And what's the relationship between physical and mental pain?

And most importantly, how can we make mental pain better?

Together with many scientists and physicians,
I spent years searching for answers to these questions.

Now, growing up, I never heard the words,
"We want you to be a doctor and a brain scientist like your father."

But somehow that's what happened.

Twelve years after my father died,
I was a graduate student at Dr. Eric Kandel’s lab
at Columbia University.

Eric, who won the Nobel Prize
for his work on the molecular basis of memory,
was the ultimate mentor.

Passionate, energetic and inspiring.

Under his guidance, I studied a receptor.

It's a protein that's part of a synapse.

And synapses are structures through which nerve cells communicate with each other.

Now that receptor was a GPCR.

That's a G protein coupled receptor.

I'll explain what this means in a minute
and then you'll understand what this stack of markers is doing here.

And when I did that,
I didn't really realize that work on that receptor,
which seemed completely unrelated to my future work
as a clinical psychiatrist,
would one day help us in our search for better treatments
for physical and mental pain.

Now a big step along that way was the work of Jaak Panksepp,
my other great scientific mentor.

In a classical experiment,
Panksepp separated puppies from their mothers for 15 minutes.
Never more than that because he loved animals.

When puppies lose their mothers,
they make a sound which is called the separation distress cry.

And it goes like this.

(Imitates puppy wailing)
Puppies do it,
kittens do it, babies do it.

All young mammals do it
when they're in pain or when they miss their mothers.

And we all know how this cry makes us feel inside.

Panksepp and his colleagues then traced the brain circuits
that produce these cries in guinea pigs,
and they made a startling discovery.

That these are the very same circuits that are active when humans feel sad
and when they experience depression.

And these circuits are also part of the brain's pain matrix
that mediates our sensations of physical and mental pain.

But why are we born with this terrible gift
hardwired into our brains?

Well, probably because like any pain, mental pain is an alarm system.
Its task is to prevent damage.

When babies lose their mothers, they hurt and they cry.

Which brings their mothers back,
and it also makes them seek their mothers.

In the wild, this is life-saving.

Puppies and babies cannot survive without their mothers.

So now we know why we have mental pain.

It is the glue that keeps us together in couples, in families and communities.

And when someone we love goes away or is taken away from us,
it's this pain which draws us back together.

And once we realize this,
then we can answer an age-old question
that poets and philosophers have been asking for thousands of years.

Does love always hurt?

What do you think?

Does love always hurt?

Yes, love always hurts, of course.

Because that's what it's supposed to do.

Mental pain is simply the high price,
the very high price, that we pay for our ability to love.

And personally,
and, you know, I've been around the block a couple of times,
personally, I think it's worth it.

But we're not entirely defenseless against pain
because our brains produce endorphins
or endogenous opioids,
our very own feel-good molecules,
the natural remedy for both physical and mental pain.

Endorphins are released in the brain during aerobic exercise
or when we're close to someone we love,
and immediately after severe injuries.

And we now know what endorphins do,
they attach to special receptors in the brain,
and the most important among them are mu opioid receptors.

And just like the receptor I worked on in Kandel's lab,
mu opioid receptors are GPCR.
Here's how they work.

Like all GPCRs, mu opioid receptors are made of seven spirals
or loops that are stacked together,
sticking through both sides of the cell membrane.

Like this, OK.

And when endorphins attach to mu opioid receptors from the outside,
they cause them to change their shape.

Like this, OK?

And this triggers a series of events inside the neurons
which eventually ease the pain.

Now, forget the molecules for a second.

When you hug someone you love
who is suffering from severe physical or mental pain,
you actually cause her brain to release endorphins.

They attach to mu opioid receptors in her synapses and turn them on,
and they soothe her pain.

And yet, sometimes mental pain gets so intense
that no amount of love can soothe it.

But medicine has powerful drugs that can ease any physical pain.
These are the narcotics or opioids like morphine.

Narcotics work mainly by activating mu opioid receptors.

But if so, can narcotics also treat the pain of separation?

It was Jaak Panksepp who found the answer.

Panksepp gave his puppies in a separation experiment
tiny, tiny doses of morphine,
lower than the lowest doses that are used to treat physical pain,
and his puppies immediately stopped crying
and started playing with each other as if they no longer miss their mothers.

Let's go to humans now.

When mental pain in humans becomes too intense to bear
people, some people, will do anything to stop it,
even try to kill themselves.

Indeed, and I'm saying this as a clinical psychiatrist,
unbearable mental pain is a huge risk factor for suicide.

But if narcotics treat physical pain,
and if they can soothe the mental pain of separation,
can they also help suicidal people become less suicidal?

A few years ago,
together with Panksepp and other colleagues,
my research team conducted a clinical trial.

We gave people who were severely suicidal very low doses of a narcotic drug,
called buprenorphine, for four weeks.

We discovered that tiny, tiny doses of buprenorphine,
which are too low to treat physical pain,
helped many of them become less suicidal.

But narcotics are extremely dangerous drugs.

They may cause addiction, and they're lethal in overdose.

In contrast, endorphins are not lethal in overdose,
and they're much less likely to cause addiction.

So narcotics and endorphins probably activate mu opioid receptors
in different ways.

Now, if we could find drugs that activate mu opioid receptors
in a way that resembles how endorphins activate them,
we might be able to treat physical and mental pain
without some of the dangerous side effects of narcotics.

And when my research team came to this conclusion,
I suddenly remembered what I had learned in Kandel's lab many, many years ago.
Some GPCRs can be activated by two different drugs at the same time.

And when this happens,
the result may be different from what happens
when they're activated by just one drug.

So our research team then used molecular computing technologies
to create a detailed virtual model of the human mu opioid receptor.

And then, with the help of programs known as molecular docking algorithms,
we screened thousands of existing drugs on a virtual model of the receptor.

Eventually, we found a way to teach an old dog,
that's the human mu opioid receptor,
some new tricks.

We found two drugs that are not narcotics,
and they work together in very, very small doses
to activate the human mu opioid receptor.

I'm not telling you their names,
because we still have to run many tests and clinical trials
before we can be certain
that their combination does exactly what we think it does.

But both of these drugs have been around for many, many years,
and they've been used by millions of people.

So we know that they're safe for humans.
Here's our bottom line.

Let's summarize what we've seen.

First and foremost, mental pain is real.

It's hardwired into our brains.

And mental pain is an essential part of mourning and depression and sadness.

And when it gets severe enough, it can actually make people suicidal.

Endorphins are brain's natural remedy for physical and mental pain,
and they work mainly, not exclusively,
but mainly by activating mu opioid receptors.

Now, narcotics also activate mu opioid receptors,
but in a way that causes addiction and can lead to death.

And this is why narcotics are so dangerous.

New computational technologies have helped us identify two existing drugs
that together may treat physical and mental pain
without some of the severe side effects of narcotics.

However, this is still a work in progress.

It would be a few years before it may become an approved treatment.

But, and this is the last thing I'm going to say,
regardless of drugs,
you have the ability to help family and friends
who are in severe physical or mental pain.

Thank you very much.

我是约拉姆·尤维尔。
"我是耶路撒冷希伯来大学的精神病学家和神经科学家
。"
"当我14岁的时候，
我的父亲去世了。"
我正在上课，
"妈妈和爷爷
敲门，"
请我到走廊去。
“你父亲病得很重，”我母亲说。
“你父亲死了。”
然后我感觉到了。
我的胸口传来一阵剧痛。
"
每当我想起我的父亲时，我仍然能感觉到这一点。"
"他是一名医生、
科学家、伞兵。"
"他是一个年轻、强壮、
快乐、健康的人。"
他是我的英雄。
他的死让我心碎。
"你还记得
有人伤了你的心时你所感受到的痛苦吗？"
"你最好的朋友
或你的母亲什么时候去世的？"
"或者你爱的人告诉你
他不再爱你了。"
你可能会。
但为什么我们会感到精神上的痛苦呢？
"
身体上的痛苦和精神上的痛苦之间有什么关系？"
"最重要的是，
我们怎样才能减轻精神上的痛苦？ 我"
"与许多科学家
和医生一起"
"花了数年时间寻找
这些问题的答案。"
现在，在成长过程中，我从未听过这样的话：
"“我们希望你像你父亲一样成为一名医生和脑
科学家。”"
但不知何故，事情就是这样发生的。
我父亲去世十二年后，
"我是哥伦比亚大学
埃里克·坎德尔博士实验室的研究生"
。
埃里克（Eric）
"因其在记忆分子基础上的研究而获得诺贝尔奖
，他"
是最终的导师。
充满激情、充满活力、鼓舞人心。
在他的指导下，我研究了一种受体。
它是一种蛋白质，是突触的一部分。
"突触是
神经细胞相互交流的结构。"
现在那个受体是 GPCR。
那是G蛋白偶联受体。
我将在一分钟内解释这意味着什么，
"然后您就会明白
这堆标记在这里的作用。"
当我这样做时，
"我并没有真正意识到
对这种受体的研究，"
"这似乎与
我未来"
作为一名临床精神病学家的工作完全无关，有一天
"会帮助我们
寻找更好的治疗"
身体和精神疼痛的方法。
"现在，
"
我的另一位伟大的科学导师雅克·潘克塞普 (Jaak Panksepp) 的工作在这条路上迈出了一大步。
在一项经典实验中，
"潘克塞普将小狗
与母亲分开 15 分钟。"
"不仅如此，
因为他热爱动物。"
当小狗失去母亲时，
"它们会发出一种称为
分离痛苦哭声的声音。 事情"
是这样的。
（模仿小狗的哭声）
小狗会这样做，
小猫会这样做，婴儿会这样做。
所有年轻的哺乳动物
"在感到疼痛
或想念母亲时都会这样做。"
"我们都知道这种哭泣
让我们内心有什么感受。"
"潘克塞普和他的同事
随后追踪了"
豚鼠产生这些哭声的大脑回路，
他们有了一个惊人的发现。
"
当人类感到悲伤"
和抑郁时，这些回路就会被激活。
"这些回路也是
大脑疼痛矩阵的一部分，"
"调节我们对
身体和精神疼痛的感觉。"
"但为什么我们生来大脑中就带有
这种可怕的天赋呢"
？
"嗯，可能是因为像任何疼痛一样，
精神上的疼痛也是一个警报系统。"
它的任务是防止损坏。
"当婴儿失去母亲时，
他们会受伤并哭泣。"
这让他们的母亲回来了，
也让他们寻找他们的母亲。
在野外，这可以挽救生命。 没有母亲，
"小狗和婴儿就无法生存
。"
现在我们知道为什么我们会有精神痛苦了。
"它是将我们
夫妻、家庭和社区凝聚在一起的粘合剂。"
"当我们所爱的人离开
或被带走时，"
"正是这种痛苦将
我们拉回到一起。"
一旦我们意识到这一点，
我们就可以回答
"诗人和哲学家
几千年来一直在问的一个古老的问题。"
爱情总是让人受伤吗？
你怎么认为？
爱情总是让人受伤吗？
是的，爱当然总是让人受伤。
因为这就是它应该做的。
精神上的痛苦只是我们为爱的能力付出的高昂代价，
"非常高昂的代价
。"
就我个人而言，
"你知道，我已经
来过这里好几次了，"
我个人认为这是值得的。
"但我们
对疼痛并非完全毫无防御能力，"
因为我们的大脑会产生内啡肽
或内源性阿片类药物，这是
我们自己感觉良好的分子，是治疗
"
身体和精神疼痛的自然疗法。"
"
在有氧运动期间"
或当我们靠近我们所爱的人时，
以及在严重受伤后，大脑会立即释放内啡肽。
我们现在知道内啡肽的作用，
"它们附着
在大脑中的特殊受体上，其中"
"最重要的
是μ阿片受体。"
"就像
我在 Kandel 实验室研究的受体一样，"
μ 阿片受体是 GPCR。
以下是它们的工作原理。
"与所有 GPCR 一样，μ 阿片受体
由七个"
堆叠在一起的螺旋或环组成，
"粘在
细胞膜的两侧。"
像这样，好吧。
"当内啡肽
从外部附着在 mu 阿片受体上时，"
它们会导致它们改变形状。
像这样，好吗？
"这会触发
神经元内部的一系列事件，"
最终缓解疼痛。
现在，暂时忘记分子。
当你拥抱一个正在
"遭受严重
身体或精神痛苦的你所爱的人时，"
"你实际上会导致她的大脑
释放内啡肽。"
"它们附着
在她突触中的 mu 阿片受体上并打开它们，"
从而缓解她的疼痛。
"然而，有时精神上的痛苦
会变得如此强烈，"
以至于再多的爱也无法缓解。
"但医学上有强大的药物
可以缓解任何身体疼痛。"
"这些是麻醉剂
或阿片类药物，如吗啡。"
"麻醉药主要通过激活
μ阿片受体发挥作用。"
"但如果是这样，麻醉剂也能治疗
分离之痛吗？"
雅克·潘克塞普找到了答案。
"潘克塞普
在一项分离实验中给他的小狗服用了"
极小剂量的吗啡，
"低于
治疗身体疼痛的最低剂量，"
"他的小狗立即
停止哭泣"
"并开始互相玩耍，
好像它们不再想念它们的母亲一样。"
现在让我们转向人类。
"当人类的精神痛苦
变得太强烈而难以忍受时"
"，有些人
会想尽办法阻止它，"
甚至试图自杀。
"事实上，
作为一名临床精神病学家，我是这么说的，"
"难以忍受的精神痛苦
是自杀的一个巨大危险因素。"
但是，如果麻醉剂可以治疗身体上的疼痛，
"并且可以缓解
分离带来的精神上的痛苦，那么"
"它们是否也可以帮助有自杀倾向的人
减少自杀倾向呢？"
几年前，我的研究团队
"与 Panksepp
和其他同事一起"
"
进行了一项临床试验。"
"我们给有严重自杀倾向的人服用
非常低剂量的麻醉药物，"
称为丁丙诺啡，为期四个星期。
"我们发现，
丁丙诺啡的剂量太低，"
不足以治疗身体疼痛，但却
帮助许多人减少了自杀倾向。
"但麻醉品是极其
危险的药物。"
"它们可能会导致成瘾，
过量服用会致命。"
"相比之下，内啡肽
过量服用并不致命，"
"而且
引起成瘾的可能性也小得多。"
"因此麻醉剂和内啡肽可能
"
以不同的方式激活μ阿片受体。
"现在，如果我们能找到以类似于内啡肽
激活μ阿片受体的方式激活μ阿片"
"
受体的药物，"
"我们也许能够治疗
身体和精神上的疼痛，"
"而不会产生
麻醉剂的一些危险副作用。"
"当我的研究团队
得出这个结论时，"
"我突然想起了
很多很多年前我在坎德尔实验室学到的东西。"
"一些 GPCR 可以
同时被两种不同的药物激活。"
当这种情况发生时，
"结果可能与
"
仅用一种药物激活它们时发生的结果不同。
"因此，我们的研究团队随后使用
分子计算技术"
"创建了
人类 mu 阿片受体的详细虚拟模型。"
"然后，在
分子对接算法程序的帮助下，"
"我们
在受体的虚拟模型上筛选了数千种现有药物。"
"最终，我们找到了一种方法
来教老狗，"
即人类μ阿片受体，
一些新技巧。
我们发现了两种非麻醉药的药物，
"它们
以非常非常小的剂量一起发挥作用，"
激活人类μ阿片受体。
我不会告诉你它们的名字，
"因为我们仍然需要进行
许多测试和临床试验，"
然后才能确定
"它们的组合
确实如我们所认为的那样。"
"但这两种药物已经
存在很多年了，"
"并且已经被
数百万人使用。"
所以我们知道它们对人类是安全的。
这是我们的底线。
让我们总结一下我们所看到的。
首先，精神上的痛苦是真实存在的。
它已经根植于我们的大脑中。
"精神痛苦是
哀悼、抑郁和悲伤的重要组成部分。"
"当它变得足够严重时，
它实际上会让人产生自杀倾向。"
"内啡肽是大脑治疗
身体和精神疼痛的天然药物，"
它们主要
"但不完全是通过激活
μ阿片受体来发挥作用。"
"现在，麻醉剂也会激活
μ阿片受体，"
"但会导致成瘾
并可能导致死亡。"
"这就是为什么麻醉品
如此危险。"
"新的计算技术帮助
我们确定了两种现有的药物，它们"
"可以一起治疗
身体和精神上的疼痛，而"
"不会产生
麻醉剂的一些严重副作用。"
然而，这仍然是一项正在进行的工作。 它
"可能需要几年时间才能
成为批准的治疗方法。"
"但是，这是我要说的最后一件事
，"
无论药物如何，
"您都有能力
帮助遭受"
严重身体或精神痛苦的家人和朋友。
非常感谢。
（掌声）
