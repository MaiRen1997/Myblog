When I was ten,
I spent a lot of time playing with my Spider-Man action figures.

I would have done anything for them to come to life.

I honestly would take Gandalf over any therapist,
but it's been pretty hard to connect with the guy
since I long ago finished all of Tolkien's works and movies.

Why is it that we have to say goodbye on the final page?
We may not need to.

Stories are changing,
moving from static sketches and scripted narratives
to living worlds and characters.

AI agents are changing the way we can tell stories.

These agents aren't just chat bots,
they're any autonomous system that can take a directive or task
and accomplish it without human intervention.

Virtual assistants like a ChatGPT,
autonomous vehicles like a Waymo or Tesla,
robots moving boxes in an Amazon warehouse.

These are all agents,
but now they're changing storytelling too.

We can bring together the active participation of video games
with a much more natural social form of interaction,
enabled by AI agents.

I want to show you a hint of what I mean.

Characters that come to life with their own personality,
styles, voices and expression,
while still being able to interact with one another,
the audience and the environment.

These interactions that you're going to see are not scripted,
many of them filmed over the last few days
here at TED and in Vancouver.

Anyways, meet Caleb.

(Video) Caleb: Oh, hey, Grandma.

Welcome to my secret attic hideout.

Grandma: What's Mr. Moose doing there?

Caleb: That's actually Brother Moose, not Mr. Moose.

He's like, the wise old moose who gives me advice and stuff.

Oh, by the way, thanks for showing me your old superhero action figure, Grandma.

It's, like, totally awesome.

What's its name?

Grandma: Mighty Squirrel.

Caleb: Really?

Grandma: Yes.

Caleb: Wow, that's so awesome.

A squirrel with super powers.

That's nuts.

Get it?

Nuts?

Like what squirrels eat.

I bet Mighty Squirrel had some epic battles with evil acorns.

Kylan Gibbs: By having that real-time responsiveness,
Caleb makes the audience feel seen and heard,
as if they're all inhabiting the shared space.

And it isn't just any audience, that's actually my amazing grandma.

The characters can also come together with one another
and take ideas from the audience and improvise new content on the fly.

(Toy robot beeping)

(Video) Robot: Ready for action!

Caleb: Whoa!

Robot: Oof! That didn't go well.

My arm is acting up.

Villains, beware!

Oops.

Caleb: Grandma, can we fix the Mighty Squirrel's arm?

Grandma: Sure.

Pick it up and put it back on his arm.

Caleb: Yeah.

I'll fix you up, Mighty Squirrel.

Your arm is broken.

Grandma: He got it caught in a washing machine.

Caleb: Ha, ha! You fought against the evil washing machine,
Magic flower.

How did the action figure break its arm?

Grandma: He fell in some water full of alligators.

Robot: Oh, you know, just your average superhero stuff.

I was on a mission to save a city from a giant alligator,
and I fell into the water.

But don't worry, I still saved the day.

KG: Each of these characters has their own internal reasoning and motivations,
but they actually take those ideas from my grandma
and then create new content in real time.

They can even allow the audience to shape the overall story arc
and conclusion of the experience.

(Video) Robot: Prepare yourselves
for the Mighty Squirrel is about to take flight.

Caleb: Haha.

Robot: Grandma, do you have anything to help me take flight again?

Grandma: There is an eagle outside on a tree.

Robot: An eagle, you say?

Perfect.

Time to spread my wings and soar through the skies.

Caleb: Whoa, Mighty Squirrel,
you're going to be the coolest flying superhero ever.

And we'll have epic battles with the evil villains.

KG: OK, so I’m mainly just jealous
that Caleb is getting to have the experience
I always wanted as a child.

But I also love seeing how he takes the story,
puts it in the audience’s hands
and turns it into a canvas for their imagination.

This is, of course, a tiny slice of what's possible,
with there already being other AI-enabled games and experiences that exist today.

Most exciting for me is a brand new genre we're seeing emerge
that takes social interaction and conversation
and puts it as the core mechanic of the experience.

So let's say instead of jump and shoot,
you actually have to use your social skills
to navigate complex social scenarios
and mediate conflicts.

That's how you win the game.

I would definitely have benefited more from that type of game
than the ones I was playing when I was a teenager.

And it's not just pure games per se.

Imagine I had an AI tutor who texted me to remind me of a session
and then jumped with me into a virtual world,
walking through the emperor’s chambers in ancient China,
casually switching between English and Chinese
as we reviewed last week's history lesson.

Or, as my family and I sat down to watch our favorite reality TV show
or sports game,
the agent could actually see
the ongoing performance in real-time using vision
and add hilarious commentary in the background.

Games, though, are unique because they already take us from passive observer
and turn us into an active participant.

When I get really deep into a game,
especially an immersive role-playing games like a Final Fantasy VII,
Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring --
yes, I'm a massive role-playing game geek --
At some point it feels like I'm in the story,
but there's still something missing.

The core mechanics of these experiences --
jump and shoot, hack and slash, point and click,
feel so distant from the natural ways
that I interact with people and things in my own life.

And so as immersed as I get in these experiences,
it kind of feels like I'm stuck on these rails set up by the developer
and nudged along from scripted point to scripted point
based on the buttons that I press.

And immersion requires a sense of real-time responsiveness,
a sense that there's a consequence that is immediate and lasting
and unique to the choices and actions that I take.

However, until now, it's been extremely difficult to pre-script
every combination of consequences
to every permutation of player behaviors.

Agents overcome this though.

Just check out how Caleb handles some unexpected scenarios here at TED.
(Video) Robot: Villains, beware!

Caleb: Grandma, do you remember how his arm got broken?
Person 1: He got in a fight with a gerbil.

Caleb: That's like, the tiniest animal ever.

Person 1: Let's just say the gerbil won the fight.

Caleb: I bet the gerbil had some secret karate moves or something.

Do you remember how his arm got broken?

Person 2: I do, he was at this conference one day,
and he did the ocean plunge and a shark came and ate it.

Robot: Superheroes are always attracting the attention of sharks.

But don't worry, I gave that shark a run for its money.

Caleb: Uncle, do you remember how his arm got broken?

Person 3: He was doing gardening.

Robot: Defending gardens from evil produce is my specialty.

Person 3: That's cool.

Caleb: That's not as cool as battling mechanical minions.

Person 3: True.

(Laughter)

KG: So it’s not just these stand-alone characters we want to bring to life,
but fully agentic, interconnected worlds
where a choice at one point
might have dramatic consequences somewhere down the line,
and the unique content produced for each user
is still grounded in a shared lore and experience
so that we have that shared social context
that we all need from media.

My company Inworld helps entertainment houses and game studios
to build these agents for the next generation of media.

And when we begin to build a character like Caleb, we start with the brain,
which is crafted in a similar way
to instructing an extremely capable improv actor.

We start by training custom machine-learning models
that give him a lay of the land, understanding the lore, vocabulary
and grammar appropriate for the experience.

And then we actually go in and we tweak his persona,
his unique personality, motivations, his flaws and biases.

We actually craft his dialogue style and voice,
the way he verbally expresses himself.

We build a unique emotional profile,
the way he feels, his social tendencies and relationship habits,
and then we preload a bunch of knowledge and memories
that give him that robust backstory.

Then we actually craft his internal reasoning and mental state,
kind of the conditions under which he feels certain things
or takes certain behaviors.

We then decide how he actually gestures and animates those behaviors,
and then that completes the brain, which we actually take
and we attach to an avatar within a virtual world or game engine,
effectively bringing it to life.

And then we're ready to play and we're playing the experience.
There's kind of an overarching narrative agent
that acts like an AI director,
managing or even generating the storyline in real time
and ensuring that all the characters and entities
cohere to their proper places within the story and context.

For specific character like Caleb,
when he's interacting with the world and characters,
he does so in a similar way to how we as humans do
with perception, cognition and behavior.

Perception is the multimodal sensory input flowing in,
the understanding of the world and context and people and objects within it.
And then with cognition, he processes that input,
kind of like the internal processing of our minds.

He filters out irrelevant information to make sure everything is safe
and narrative aligned.

He extracts out important signals like sentiment, intent, emotional cues.
He retrieves relevant memories from his past
and even generates new ones on the fly.

Finally reasoning over what to do both verbally and non-verbally.

And finally with behavior, he actually generates his responses.

He decides what to say and how to say it,
what facial and body gestures to use,
what actions to take,
and people and objects to interact with.

And that's what brings the character to life.
And so, as amazed as I am by all these task-focused applications of AI
that are coming out,
the more I work with studios and creatives,
the more excited I am for the potential
for these agents to extend human creative potential,
and for them to allow audiences to step beyond the script.

For them to give audiences agency
and allow them to co-create experiences that stem from their own imagination.

To finish it off, here's a few funny takes from here at TED,
starting with Polly, whose son is actually named Caleb.

(Video) Person 4: Are you ready to play [unclear] Caleb?

Caleb: Absolutely, grandma.

Let's dive into some epic superhero adventures together.

Person 4: Let's do it.

Person 5: Can you hear me?

Caleb: Of course I can hear you, silly.

I love playing basketball.

Person 3: Oh, wow. And which is your favorite basketball player?

Caleb: Definitely LeBron James.

Person 3: Sure.

Caleb: Thanks for showing me your old superhero action figure.

Person 1: You mean the man in his underwear?

Caleb: Haha, yeah.

He's like a tough guy in his undies ready to save the world.

What's its name?

Person 6: Johnny May Rotten Bad.

Caleb: Uncle, you're so silly.

(Laughter)

Does he have, like, a guitar for a weapon?

Person 6: He sure does.

Caleb: No way.

Person 6: Way.

Caleb: No way.

Person 6: Way.

Caleb: Does he zap bad guys with his electric powers?

Person 7: No, no, no, no, no.

He zaps people and gives them love.

He’s a nice superhero.

Caleb: Wow, that's different.

He uses love to fight the bad guys.

Person 7: Yeah, and guess what?

Caleb: That's so cool.

Person 7: He always wins.

(Applause)

KG: So it seems like there’s a pretty solid chance
my Spider-Man action figures could come to life after all.

Thank you.

(Applause)

当我十岁的时候，
"我花了很多时间玩
我的蜘蛛侠动作玩偶。 为了让它们复活，"
"我愿意做任何事
。"
"老实说，我会选择甘道夫而不是
任何治疗师，"
"但
"
"自从我很久以前完成了
托尔金的所有作品和电影以来，很难与他建立联系。"
"为什么我们要
在最后一页说再见？"
我们可能不需要。
故事正在发生变化，
"从静态的草图
和脚本化的叙述转变"
为活生生的世界和人物。
"人工智能代理正在改变
我们讲故事的方式。"
这些代理不仅仅是聊天机器人，
"它们是任何
可以接受指令或任务"
"并
无需人工干预即可完成的自治系统。"
ChatGPT 等虚拟助手、
Waymo 或 Tesla 等自动驾驶汽车、
"
亚马逊仓库中搬运箱子的机器人。"
这些都是特工，
但现在他们也在改变故事讲述方式。
"我们可以将
视频游戏的积极参与"
"与人工智能代理支持的更自然的
社交互动形式结合起来"
。
我想向你展示一下我的意思。
"角色
以自己的个性、"
风格、声音和表情栩栩如生，
"同时仍然能够
与彼此、"
观众和环境互动。
"你将看到的这些互动
并不是有剧本的，"
其中许多是过去几天
在 TED 和温哥华拍摄的。
不管怎样，来认识一下迦勒吧。
（视频）迦勒：哦，嘿，奶奶。
欢迎来到我的秘密阁楼藏身处。
奶奶：驼鹿先生在那儿做什么？
"迦勒：那实际上是
驼鹿弟兄，而不是驼鹿先生。"
"他就像一头聪明的老驼鹿，
给我建议和东西。"
"哦，顺便说一句，谢谢你向我展示
你的老超级英雄动作玩偶，奶奶。"
这真是太棒了。
它叫什么名字？
奶奶：强大的松鼠。
迦勒：真的吗？
奶奶：是的。
迦勒：哇，太棒了。
一只拥有超能力的松鼠。
那太疯狂了。
得到它？
坚果？
就像松鼠吃的东西一样。
"我敢打赌，强大的松鼠与邪恶的橡子进行了一些史诗般的
战斗。"
"凯兰·吉布斯（Kylan Gibbs）：通过
实时响应，"
"Caleb 让观众
感觉自己被看到和听到，"
"就好像他们都居住在
共享空间中一样。"
"这不仅仅是任何观众，
这实际上是我了不起的奶奶。"
"角色还可以
彼此聚集在一起，"
"从观众那里汲取想法，
并即兴创作新内容。"
（玩具机器人发出蜂鸣声）
（视频）机器人：准备行动！
迦勒：哇！
机器人：噢！ 进展并不顺利。
我的手臂开始活动了。
恶人，小心！
哎呀。
"迦勒：奶奶，我们能修好
松鼠的手臂吗？"
奶奶：当然。
把它捡起来，放回他的手臂上。
迦勒：是的。
我会收拾你的，强大的松鼠。
你的手臂断了。
"奶奶：他把它卡
在洗衣机里了。"
"迦勒：哈，哈！ 你
与邪恶的洗衣机战斗，"
魔幻花。
人偶的手臂是如何折断的？
"奶奶：他掉进了
满是鳄鱼的水里。"
"机器人：哦，你知道，
只是普通的超级英雄的东西。"
"我正在执行一项任务，
从巨型鳄鱼手中拯救一座城市，"
结果我掉进了水里。
但别担心，我仍然挽救了这一天。
"KG：每个角色都有自己的
内在推理和动机，"
"但他们实际上是
从我祖母那里获取这些想法，"
然后实时创建新内容。
"它们甚至可以让观众
塑造整个故事情节"
和体验的结论。
（视频）机器人：
"为
即将起飞的松鼠做好准备。"
迦勒：哈哈。
"机器人：奶奶，你有什么办法可以
帮助我再次飞翔吗？"
"奶奶：
外面的树上有一只鹰。"
机器人：你说一只鹰？
完美的。 是
"时候展开翅膀，
翱翔天空了。"
迦勒：哇哦，强大的松鼠，
"你将成为有史以来
最酷的飞行超级英雄。"
"我们将与邪恶的恶棍进行史诗般的战斗
。"
KG：好吧，所以我主要是嫉妒
"凯勒布获得了
"
我小时候一直想要的经历。
"但我也喜欢看到
他如何将这个故事"
交给观众，
"并将其变成
供他们想象的画布。"
"当然，这只是可能性的一小
部分，目前已经"
"存在其他人工智能
游戏和体验。"
"对我来说最令人兴奋的是我们看到一种全新的
类型出现，它将"
"社交互动
和对话"
"作为
体验的核心机制。"
因此，我们可以说，
"你实际上必须使用
社交技能"
来驾驭复杂的社交场景
并调解冲突，而不是跳跃和射击。
这就是你赢得比赛的方式。 与我十几岁时玩的游戏相比，
"我肯定会
从这种类型的游戏中受益更多。"
而且它本身不仅仅是纯粹的游戏。
"想象一下，我有一位人工智能导师，他给我发短信
提醒我某堂课，"
"然后和我一起
跳入虚拟世界，"
"走过
中国古代的皇帝寝宫，在复习上周的历史课时，"
"随意地在
英语和汉语之间切换"
。
"或者，当我和我的家人坐下来
观看我们最喜欢的真人秀"
或体育比赛时，
经纪人实际上可以使用视觉实时看到
"正在进行的表演，
"
"并在背景中添加搞笑的评论
。"
"然而，游戏是独一无二的，因为它们
已经把我们从被动的观察者"
变成了积极的参与者。
当我真正深入一款游戏时，
"尤其是沉浸式角色扮演
游戏，如《最终幻想 VII》、《"
博德之门 3》或《埃尔登之戒》——
"是的，我是一个
角色扮演游戏极客——"
"在某些时候，我感觉
就像 我在故事里，"
但还缺少一些东西。
这些体验的核心机制——
"跳跃和射击、砍伐和砍杀、
指向和点击，"
感觉与
"我
在自己的生活中与人和事互动的自然方式相距甚远。"
"因此，当我沉浸
在这些体验中时，"
"感觉就像我被困在
开发人员设置的这些轨道上，"
"并
"
根据我按下的按钮从一个脚本点推到另一个脚本点。
"沉浸感需要一种
实时响应的感觉，一种我所采取的选择和行动会"
"
立即产生持久"
"且独特的后果的感觉
。"
"然而，到目前为止，预先
编写玩家行为的每种排列的"
后果的每种组合是极其困难的
。
不过，特工们克服了这个问题。
"只要看看 Caleb
在 TED 上如何处理一些意外情况即可。"
（视频）机器人：恶棍，小心！
"迦勒：奶奶，你还记得
他的手臂是怎么折断的吗？ 第一"
个人：他和一只沙鼠打架了。
"迦勒：这就像
有史以来最小的动物。"
"第一个人：假设
沙鼠赢得了这场战斗。"
"迦勒：我打赌沙鼠有一些秘密的
空手道动作什么的。"
你还记得他的手臂是怎么折断的吗？
"第二个人：我知道，
有一天他参加了这个会议，"
"他跳进了大海，
结果一只鲨鱼来了，把它吃了。"
"机器人：超级英雄总是能吸引
鲨鱼的注意。"
"但别担心，我已经和那条鲨鱼展开了
竞争。"
"迦勒：叔叔，你还记得
他的手臂是怎么折断的吗？"
第三个人：他正在做园艺。
"机器人：保护花园免受
邪恶产物的侵害是我的专长。"
第三个人：那太酷了。
"迦勒：这并不
像与机械小兵战斗那么酷。"
第三个人：确实如此。
（笑声）
"KG：所以
我们想要赋予生命的不仅仅是这些独立的角色，"
而是完全自主的、相互关联的世界，
在这个世界中，某一时刻的选择
"可能会在未来的某个地方产生戏剧性的后果
，"
"并且为每个用户制作独特的内容
"
"仍然以共同的
知识和经验为基础，"
因此我们拥有媒体所需要的共同的社会背景
。
"我的公司 Inworld 帮助
娱乐公司和游戏工作室"
"
为下一代媒体构建这些代理。"
"当我们开始塑造
像迦勒这样的角色时，我们从大脑开始，"
它的制作方式类似于
"指导一个非常
有能力的即兴演员。"
"我们首先训练定制的
机器学习模型，"
"让他了解情况，
了解适合体验的知识、词汇"
"和语法
。"
"然后我们实际上进入
并调整他的角色，"
"他独特的个性，
动机，他的缺点和偏见。"
"我们实际上精心设计了他的对话
风格和声音，以及"
他口头表达自己的方式。
我们建立了一个独特的情感档案，
"他的感受方式，他的社交倾向
和人际关系习惯，"
"然后我们预先加载了一堆
知识和记忆，为"
他提供了丰富的背景故事。
"然后，我们实际上塑造了他的
内部推理和心理状态，"
"即
他感受到某些事物"
或采取某些行为的条件。
"然后我们决定他实际上如何做出手势
和动画这些行为，"
"然后完成大脑，
"
"我们实际上将其附加到
虚拟世界或游戏引擎中的化身，"
有效地使其栩栩如生。
"然后我们就准备好玩了，
我们正在玩体验。"
"有一种总体
叙事代理，"
其作用就像人工智能导演一样，实时
"管理甚至生成
故事情节，"
"并确保所有
角色和实体"
"
在故事和上下文中保持在适当的位置。"
对于像迦勒这样的特定角色，
"当他
与世界和角色互动时，"
"他的
方式与我们人类的"
感知、认知和行为方式类似。
"感知是流入的多模态
感官输入，是对"
"世界、环境
以及其中的人和物体的理解。"
"然后通过认知，
他处理该输入，"
"有点像
我们思想的内部处理。"
"他过滤掉不相关的信息，
以确保一切都是安全的"
并且叙述一致。
"他提取出重要的信号，
如情绪、意图、情绪线索。"
"他
从过去检索相关记忆，"
甚至即时生成新的记忆。
"最后推理
出口头和非口头上该做什么。"
"最后，通过行为，
他实际上产生了自己的反应。"
他决定说什么、如何说、
使用什么面部和身体姿势、
采取什么行动
以及与人和物体互动。
"这就是让
角色栩栩如生的原因。"
"因此，尽管我对所有
这些以任务为中心的人工智能应用程序的"
出现感到惊讶，但
"我
与工作室和创意人员合作的越多，"
我对
"这些代理扩展
人类创造力潜力的潜力就越感到兴奋，"
"并且 他们让观众
超越剧本。"
让他们为观众提供代理权，
"让他们共同创造
源于自己想象力的体验。"
"最后，这里有一些
来自 TED 的有趣片段，"
"首先是 Polly，他的儿子
实际上名叫 Caleb。"
"（视频）第四人：你准备好
扮演[不清楚]迦勒吗？"
迦勒：当然，奶奶。
"让我们一起深入了解一些史诗般的
超级英雄冒险。"
第四个人：我们开始吧。
第五个人：你能听到我说话吗？
迦勒：我当然能听到你说话，傻瓜。
我喜欢打篮球。
"第三个人：噢，哇。
你最喜欢的篮球运动员是哪位？"
迦勒：绝对是勒布朗·詹姆斯。
第三个人：当然。
"迦勒：谢谢你向我展示
你的旧超级英雄动作玩偶。"
"第一个人：你是说那个
穿着内衣的男人吗？"
迦勒：哈哈，是的。
"他就像一个穿着内衣的硬汉，
准备拯救世界。"
它叫什么名字？
第六人：约翰尼·梅·烂烂。
迦勒：叔叔，你真傻。
（笑声）
"他有
吉他之类的武器吗？"
第六号：他确实这么做了。
迦勒：不可能。
第六人：方式。
迦勒：不可能。
第六人：方式。
"迦勒：他会
用电力消灭坏人吗？"
第七个人：不，不，不，不，不。
他激励人们并给予他们爱。
他是一个很好的超级英雄。
迦勒：哇，那不一样。
他用爱来对抗坏人。
第七个人：是的，你猜怎么着？
迦勒：那太酷了。
第七个人：他总是赢。
（掌声）
"KG：看来
"
"我的蜘蛛侠人偶很有可能
变成现实。"
谢谢。
（掌声）
