I was 12 years old when I came face-to-face with the paradox of meat.
I was at my friend's birthday party.

There was a lot of fun, music, celebration and games in the front of the house.

So I ran into the backyard looking for more fun.

And what I stumbled upon shocked me.

There were people slaughtering frightened animals for the birthday feast.

This was a strange feeling.

As a 12-year-old kid, seeing intense suffering in the back and sheer joy in the front, juxtaposing a birthday with a death day all in the same instance was too much to handle.

The 12-year-old me broke down into tears.

I know this is a common experience for many of you, and probably many of your children.

We all know at some level that the meat that we eat today has a really troubling story behind it.

We know that billions of animals are raised in painful, overcrowded conditions and not in the idyllic pastures that we'd like to believe in.

We know that climate change is caused -- a leading cause for it, in fact, is meat production.

We also know that factory farming is responsible for the spread of incredibly scary diseases, and also to the rising antibiotic resistance.

But despite all of this, you probably will continue to eat meat.

In fact, the world is going to eat twice the amount of meat in the first half of this century than when we started.

So despite all of this, why?

Why is the question.

Do we really have a solution for it?

I'm not sure yet.

But I'll tell you why this is a complex question to answer, because meat is the most incredibly delicious food that we've gotten used to.

No disrespect to salads or beans.

It's been part of our culture, traditions and religion for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

We love the product, not so much the process.

So we've learned to ignore the conflict by simply turning a blind eye.

And I think this is the central conflict that a conflicted carnivore deals with.

So is there a way out for a conflicted carnivore?

I believe there is.

In fact, I am betting on it.

About eight years ago, I quit my job as a cardiologist and moved my family across the country to start a team solely focused on working on solving this problem.

I cofounded a company called UPSIDE Foods
to work on a crazy idea called cultivated meat.

It's based on a simple principle that all the meat we eat comes from a bunch of animal cells.

So we asked the question, could we just grow the animal cells directly into meat without having to raise the animal?

And it turns out that this idea was rooted in science fiction for many, many decades.

And I want to show you and illustrate to you how we can do this with chicken.

So let's start off with a chicken or an egg.

What we do is we take a small sample of cells from the egg or the chicken, and we identify the cells that are high-quality and continue to grow outside the animal into chicken meat.

Once we have the right cells, we save them for later or when we want to make chicken, we pull them out in a small sample just like the one that will fit in a vial like this.

Inside this vial you could expect to see millions of cells just like the ones you're seeing on the slide.

Now remember, the life of a chicken started with a single cell that grew and multiplied into millions and billions of cells.

So we take these cells and put them in a cultivator.

You might ask, what is a cultivator?

A cultivator is nothing but a clean vessel that provides a safe and nurturing and warm environment for the cells to grow into chicken meat.

They can come in a small size, like the size of a water bottle, or they could be as tall as one to two stories, steel, clean,  gleaming tanks like the one you're seeing behind me.

Once we grow this meat for about two weeks, we are ready to harvest it and shape it into the products that we love.

Whole cut products or cut products.

And it's common to mix some of these products with plant-based fibers to add texture.

This can be done with beef, salmon, duck, or any species that you can imagine.

And once we have the cells we want, we do not have to go back to the animal.

In fact, the cells we've been using to grow chicken, we've taken them from an egg in 2018, and for six years we haven't had to go back to the animal again.

It's a kinder way to make meat, but it's also kinder to the environment.

A number of studies are showing, for instance, for cultivated beef, when grown at scale, using renewable energy, has a 90 percent lower greenhouse gas emissions, 90 percent lower land use and lower pollution.

It's also cleaner in the absence of animal waste or the need to use antibiotics that increase the risk of infections, whether it's E-coli or salmonella.

We can have really clean conditions for manufacturing.

Now, I think you're certainly thinking that this is science fiction for sure, this is crazy, but eight years ago, when I started UPSIDE Foods, a number of people laughed at me and our team.

Let me show you the rapid progress that's happened in the last eight years.

In 2016, we showed the world the first cultivated beef meatball and followed that up in 2017 by showing the first ever cultivated duck or chicken.

This proved science.

This was proof of science for multiple species over a few years.

So what's next?

The most important thing next was to prove safety.

We started working with the top two regulators in the United States, the FDA and the USDA, and over multiple years, and after thorough examinations of our process, we got the green light to release our products into the market less than a year ago, in July 2023.

I have to tell you, the next part of this is the consumer.

You might ask, how does it taste?

The faces of these people, hardcore meat eaters and vegetarians alike, will tell you the story that this is delicious.

In fact, our favorite quote is from “The Washington Post,” where the James Beard Award-winning writer wrote that "this was the most chickeny chicken" he's tasted in a long time.

Alright, so speaking of delicious, our chef here has been busy cooking some of the products that I want to show to you.

Let me show or illustrate how this could work in your life.

Imagine a week.

It starts off with a Sunday, and your kids want you to cook breakfast.

And their favorite breakfast is a breakfast sausage.

Let me show you how that could look.

Thank you. David.

OK, for instance, there's a cultivated chicken breakfast sausage.

It's delicious, it's juicy.

I want to eat it right now.

But there's more.

I want you to think about Wednesday.

You're on a work trip and you want to get a quick power lunch.

Imagine this.

A protein-packed chicken salad that has delicious golden brown chicken on it.

And I want to eat this, too.

But there's more.

(Laughter)

Now it's Friday, end of the week, thank God.

And you want to go to a really relaxing and romantic dinner with your partner.

And you want to impress your partner by taking your partner to the restaurant closest to you and asking for the best thing on the menu, that shows what a great person you are.

(Laughter)

And we have that for you too.

Thank you, David.

So this is a delicious chicken breast, tender and juicy and cooked in front of you, sizzling on the plate.

And your partner takes a bite.

And says, "Hmm."

(Laughter)

"The most chickeny chicken I've ever had."

(Laughter)

Alright, so what comes next?

This industry is growing rapidly.

I'm really thrilled to see there is about 170 companies in this space in every continent except Antarctica.

And multiple research organizations, like the Good Food Institute, working on making this available and building training programs at the universities.

We've got multiple countries giving regulatory approvals: the United States, Singapore, Israel and soon to be also Australia.

We've got three billion dollars being put to work.

And hear this, South Korea has just started a free economic zone to encourage cultivated meat to be commercialized rapidly and China has added this to their five-year plan.

There are a number of companies across the world ready to bring delicious products to the market.

And just look at this.

They could be whole-cut products, they could be steaks, they could be beloved foods like hot dogs, burgers or sushi.

Folks, there is a global race and never in history has an idea of this magnitude moved from an idea stage to this level of interest in a span of less than a decade.

So what comes next?

The next step is proof of scale.

We have to work and see if the industry can scale to meet the size of the problem we're trying to go after.

This means we'll have to build much larger, bigger, more efficient manufacturing facilities and supply chains.

We've already lowered the cost by 100-fold, but teams across the world are working relentlessly to lower the cost even further.

This is an example of our production facility that was built in California during COVID, where we've been producing cultivated meat regularly for the last 12 to 18 months, and improving operations and designs to make it a blueprint for much larger production facilities.

And we've released all of this across openly for the world to see.

And I think more and more of this is needed.

So what other challenges exist?

Timelines are hard to predict.

Regulatory approvals are hard to predict, but I believe multiple companies will be available in restaurants serving their products in the next few years, and then next five to 10 years, these should be available widely in retail.

Continuing to lower costs further does not come easily.

There is also hurdles related to making meat that's not just less bad, but I'm really excited about walking the path of making meat that is more good.

For example, as a cardiologist, nothing gets me more excited than opening the path of meat to be more tastier and healthier.

Imagine, steak with a nutritional profile of a salmon.

I think that's the future that I'm very excited about.

But our challenges are not just technological or manufacturing challenges or funding challenges.

There are also social and political challenges.

Florida just banned and criminalized cultivated meat production last month.

Alabama is doing it as of October this year and Italy earlier this year.

All in an attempt to protect an age-old industry from competition.

But I truly believe people, businesses and communities in these places will benefit from cultivated meat as well as the rest of the world.

So this is no idealistic fantasy.

Throughout history, transformative innovations have always triumphed over deep, entrenched opposition, reshaping societies for the better.

This is no different.

It is the indomitable spirit of the people in the arena that will be foundational to push this innovation through.

But we can't do it alone.

We'll need a lot of people, cheerleaders, politicians crossing party lines, people, businesses, investors and incumbent industry joining this work.

Because investing in a critical idea like this, cultivated meat, for the future to keep all the foods we love on the table,
as well as opening an enormous economic, ethical and environmental opportunity is right in front of us.

I leave you with one closing thought.

I truly believe that cultivated meat offers this rare opportunity to bring people of every stripe together under the big tent, those who love meat and those who object to the slaughter of animals.

Those who prize innovation and those who prize tradition.

Those who love choice and those who value life.

It's our chance, if you can forgive the joke, to have our chicken and eat it too.

(Laughter)

Thank you very much.

(Applause)

当我12岁的时候，我就
"直面了
肉食的悖论。"
我当时正在参加我朋友的生日聚会。 房子前面
有很多乐趣、音乐、
"庆祝活动和游戏
。"
"于是我跑到后院
寻找更多的乐趣。"
我偶然发现的事情让我震惊。
"人们
在生日宴会上宰杀受惊的动物。"
这是一种奇怪的感觉。
作为一个 12 岁的孩子，
"看到后面的剧烈痛苦
和前面的纯粹欢乐，将"
"生日
与死亡日放在"
"同一时刻，
实在让人难以承受。"
12岁的我泪流满面。
"我知道这
对你们许多人（"
或许还有你们的许多孩子）来说是一种常见的经历。
我们都在某种程度上知道，
我们今天吃的肉
背后有一个非常令人不安的故事。
"我们知道，数十亿动物
是在痛苦、"
过度拥挤的条件下饲养的，
"而不是在我们愿意相信的田园诗般的牧场上饲养的
。"
我们知道气候变化是造成的——
"事实上，其主要原因
是肉类生产。"
我们还知道，工厂化养殖
"是导致
极其可怕的疾病传播"
"以及
抗生素耐药性不断上升的原因。"
"但尽管如此，
你可能会继续吃肉。"
"事实上，
"
"本世纪上半叶世界的肉类消费量将是本世纪初的两倍
。"
那么尽管如此，
为什么呢？
为什么是这个问题。
我们真的有解决办法吗？
我不肯定。
"但我会告诉你为什么
这是一个复杂的问题，"
"因为肉是我们已经习惯的最
美味的食物"
。
没有对沙拉或豆类的不尊重。 数百年甚至数千年以来，
"它一直是我们文化、
传统和宗教的一部分"
。
"我们喜欢的是产品，而
不是过程。"
"因此，我们学会了
通过视而不见来忽视冲突。"
"我认为这是
一个有冲突的食肉动物要处理的核心冲突。"
"那么，
对于一个矛盾的食肉动物来说，有没有出路呢？"
我相信有。
事实上，我正在打赌。
"大约八年前，
我辞去了心脏病专家的工作，"
举家搬到全国各地，
"组建了一个专门
致力于解决这个问题的团队。"
我与他人共同创立了一家名为 UPSIDE Foods 的公司，
"致力于研究一个
名为“人造肉”的疯狂想法。"
"它基于一个简单的原理：
我们吃的所有肉都"
来自一堆动物细胞。
所以我们提出了一个问题，
"我们是否可以直接将动物细胞培养
成肉"
而不需要饲养动物？ 事实
证明，
"这个想法几十年来一直根植
于科幻小说中"
。
我想向您展示
"并说明
我们如何用鸡肉做到这一点。"
"那么，让我们从先有
鸡还是先有蛋开始吧。"
"我们所做的就是
从鸡蛋或鸡肉中提取少量细胞样本，"
"然后识别出高质量的细胞，
"
"并在
动物体外继续生长成鸡肉。"
一旦我们拥有了合适的细胞，
我们就会将它们保存起来供以后使用，
或者当我们想要制作鸡肉时，
我们将它们取出到一个小样本中，
"就像
适合装入这样的小瓶中的样本一样。"
在这个小瓶中，
您可能会看到数百万个细胞，
"就像
您在幻灯片上看到的那样。"
现在请记住，鸡的生命
始于一个细胞，
"然后生长并繁殖
成数百万个细胞。"
"所以我们将这些细胞
放入培养器中。"
你可能会问，什么是修炼者？
培养器只不过是一个干净的容器，为细胞生长成鸡肉
提供安全、培育
"和温暖的环境
。"
"它们的尺寸可以很小，
比如水瓶大小，"
"也可以高达
一到两层楼，"
"钢制、干净、闪闪发光的水箱，
就像你在我身后看到的那样。"
"一旦我们将这种肉种植了
大约两周，"
我们就可以收获它
"并将其塑造成
我们喜欢的产品。"
整切产品或切割产品。
"通常将
其中一些产品"
与植物纤维混合以增加质感。
"这可以
用牛肉、鲑鱼、鸭肉"
或任何你能想象到的物种来完成。
一旦我们获得了我们想要的细胞，
我们就不必再回到动物身上。
"事实上，我们
用来培育鸡的细胞是"
在 2018 年从鸡蛋中取出的，
"六年来我们不必
再次回到动物身上。"
这是一种更友善的肉类制作方式，
而且对环境也更友善。 例如，
"多项研究
表明，"
对于使用可再生能源进行大规模种植的养殖牛肉而言，
"
温室气体排放量可减少 90%，"
"土地使用量可减少 90%，
污染也可减少。"
"
由于没有动物粪便"
"或需要使用
增加感染风险的抗生素（"
无论是大肠杆菌还是沙门氏菌），它也更清洁。
"我们可以拥有真正清洁的
制造条件。"
"现在，我想你肯定认为
这肯定是科幻小说，"
这太疯狂了，
"但八年前，
当我创办 UPSIDE Foods 时，"
"很多人
嘲笑我和我们的团队。"
"让我向您展示
过去八年中所发生的快速进展。"
"2016 年，我们向世界展示了
第一个人工培育的牛肉丸，"
并于 2017 年向世界
"展示了第一个人
工培育的鸭子或鸡肉。"
这证明是科学的。
"这是多年来多个物种的科学证明
。"
下一个是什么？
"接下来最重要的
是证明安全。"
"我们开始与
美国两大监管机构"
FDA 和 USDA 合作，
经过多年的合作，在对
"
我们的流程进行彻底检查后，不到一年前，"
"我们获得了将
产品投放市场的许可"
，  2023 年 7 月。
我必须告诉你，
下一部分是消费者。
你可能会问，味道怎么样？
这些人，无论是
"铁杆肉食者
还是素食者，他们的面孔"
"都会告诉你
这是美味的故事。"
"事实上，我们最喜欢的一句话
来自《华盛顿邮报》，"
"詹姆斯·比尔德
奖获奖作家在其中写道，"
"“这是
他很长一段时间以来尝过的最鸡肉的鸡肉”。"
好了，说到美味，
"我们这里的厨师一直在忙着
做一些"
我想给大家展示的产品。
"让我展示或说明
这如何在你的生活中发挥作用。"
想象一下一周。
从周日开始，
您的孩子希望您做早餐。
"他们最喜欢的早餐
是早餐香肠。"
让我向您展示这会是什么样子。
谢谢。 大卫。
"好的，例如，有一种培植
鸡肉早餐香肠。"
很好吃，多汁。
我现在就想吃它。
但还有更多。
我想让你想想星期三。
您正在出差，
想要快速享用一顿营养丰富的午餐。
想象一下这个。
富含蛋白质的鸡肉沙拉，上面
"有美味的
金棕色鸡肉。"
而且我也想吃这个。
但还有更多。
（笑声）
"现在是周五，
周末，感谢上帝。"
"您想
与您的伴侣共进一顿真正轻松浪漫的晚餐。"
如果你想给你的伴侣留下深刻的印象，
"可以带你的伴侣
去离你最近的餐厅，"
并要求菜单上最好的东西，
这表明你是一个多么伟大的人。
（笑声）
我们也为你准备了这个。
谢谢你，大卫。
这就是美味的鸡胸肉，
鲜嫩多汁，
在你面前煮熟，
在盘子上滋滋作响。
你的伴侣也咬了一口。
并说：
“嗯。”
（笑声）
“我吃过的最鸡的鸡。”
（笑声）
好吧，那么接下来会发生什么呢？
这个行业正在迅速增长。
"我真的很高兴看到除南极洲外每个大陆都有
大约 170 家该领域的公司"
。
"多个研究组织，
例如 Good Food Institute，"
正在致力于提供这一服务
"并在大学建立培训项目
。"
"我们已经获得多个国家/地区的
监管批准："
"美国、新加坡、以色列，
澳大利亚也即将获得批准。"
"我们已经投入了三十亿美元
。"
听说，
"韩国刚刚启动了
一个自由经济区，"
"以鼓励培育肉类
迅速商业化，"
"而中国已将其添加
到他们的五年计划中。 世界各地"
"有许多公司
"
"准备将美味的
产品推向市场。"
看看这个。
它们可以是全切产品，
可以是牛排，也
"可以是
热狗、汉堡或寿司等深受喜爱的食物。"
各位，这是一场全球性的竞赛，
"历史上从未有过
如此规模的想法在不到十年的时间内"
"从一个想法阶段转变为如此
受关注的水平"
。
那么接下来会发生什么呢？
下一步是规模证明。
"我们必须努力，看看
这个行业是否能够扩大规模，"
"以满足
我们正在努力解决的问题的规模。"
"这意味着我们必须建造
更大、更大、"
"更高效的制造
设施和供应链。"
"我们已经将
成本降低了 100 倍，"
"但世界各地的团队
正在不懈努力，"
以进一步降低成本。
"这是
我们在新"
冠疫情期间在加利福尼亚州建造的生产设施的一个例子，
在过去的 12 到 18 个月里，我们一直在定期生产人造肉，
并改进运营和设计，
"使其成为更大
生产设施的蓝图。"
"我们已将所有这些内容公开发布
给全世界。"
"我认为
需要越来越多的这样的事情。"
那么还存在哪些其他挑战呢？
时间表很难预测。
监管部门的批准很难预测，
"但我相信未来几年内多家公司
将在餐馆"
"提供其产品
，"
然后在未来五到十年内，
"这些产品应该
在零售业广泛使用。"
"继续进一步降低成本
并不容易。"
"制作
肉不仅不那么糟糕，而且还存在一些障碍，"
"但我真的很高兴
能够走上"
制作更好的肉的道路。
例如，作为一名心脏病专家，
"没有什么
比开辟肉类"
变得更美味、更健康的道路更让我兴奋的了。
"想象一下，牛排
的营养成分与鲑鱼一样。"
"我认为这就是
我感到非常兴奋的未来。"
"但我们的挑战不仅仅是
技术或制造挑战"
或资金挑战。
"还有社会
和政治挑战。"
"佛罗里达州上个月刚刚禁止
养殖肉类生产并将其定为犯罪。"
"阿拉巴马州
将于今年 10 月开始实施，"
意大利则于今年早些时候实施。
"所有这些都是为了保护
这个古老的行业免受竞争。"
但我坚信，
"这些地方的人民、企业和社区以及世界其他地区都
将受益于人造肉"
。
所以这不是理想主义的幻想。
纵观历史，
"变革性创新
总是战胜"
"根深蒂固的根深蒂固的反对派，
使社会变得更好。"
这没什么不同。
"
舞台上人们不屈不挠的精神"
"将成为
推动这一创新的基础。"
但我们不能单独做到这一点。
我们需要很多人、啦啦队员、
"跨越党派界限的政客、
民众、企业、"
"投资者和现有行业
加入这项工作。"
"因为投资像人造肉
这样的关键理念"
，让未来我们可以
"吃到
我们喜爱的所有食物，"
并开启巨大的经济、
道德和环境机会，
就在我们面前。
我留给你们一个最后的想法。
"我坚信，人造肉
提供了这个难得的机会，"
"可以将各种类型的人们
聚集在大帐篷下，"
那些热爱肉类的人和
"那些反对
屠宰动物的人。"
那些珍视创新的人和
那些珍视传统的人。
热爱选择的人，
珍视生命的人。
如果你能原谅这个笑话的话，我们
就有机会吃我们的鸡了。
（笑声）
非常感谢。
（掌声）
