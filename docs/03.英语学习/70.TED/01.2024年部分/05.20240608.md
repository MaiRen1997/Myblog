I'm a techno-optimist, but techno-optimism should be practiced with both empathy and care.

And I’m a believer in what is possible if you do it that way.

First, I'm going to give you a word of warning.

Experts extrapolate the past.

They prevent radical progress because they don't think nonlinearly.

They don't think of the improbable.

I personally believe only the improbables are important.

We just don't know which improbable is important.

Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, with a passion for a vision, they dream the dreams, and then are foolish enough, and we need more foolishness, to try and make those implausible dreams come true.

That's what entrepreneurship is about, something I've loved my whole life.

In the 40 years, I’ve been doing innovation and innovation only.

This may surprise people.

I can't think of a single large social impact change that was driven by an expert in the field,
possibly with the exception of biotechnology, that's driven by an expert, by a large institution,
a large non-founder-led company.

Think about it. In 40 years, not one example.

Whether you look at SpaceX, or electric cars or Uber, not one example.

The earliest one I could think of was credit cards in the early 70s, when Bank of America put credit on plastic.

So what is this plausible world?

I'll go through a dozen scenarios that I believe most experts will pooh-pooh.

Most expertise enabled by AI will be free.

I'm most excited that every human being on the planet can have, 24/7, a free doctor, primary care in a very expansive way.

That every child can have a free tutor in a very available, accessible way, and these will be near free.

It doesn't matter, other expertise whether you're looking at structural engineers or oncologists, most expertise will be near free.

The cost of computing.

Most labor will also be free.

I can imagine a billion bipedal robots doing more work than all of human labor does today, freeing humans from the servitude of some of the jobs.

Working at General Motors on an assembly line for eight hours a day, doing the same thing for 30 years.

That's not a job. That's almost slavery.

I do believe we will have enough abundance to take care of everybody who is displaced.

And that's where the empathy part of techno-optimism comes in.

We will have enough for redistribution to happen.

Programming will be near free also.

And though we think of computers as pervasive today, I think they'll be much more prevalent,
much more pervasive and expansive.

In fact, I think we will think of computers almost like a utility.

How many of you think about electricity?

That's how it will be in the background, not in our face.

And like this little Rabbit device I have in my hand, we'll just talk to it.

It'll understand human instruction.

Computers will adapt to humans.

We won't have to have humans learn computer.

Five years ago, when I first spoke at a conference in Toronto on the role AI will play in music generation, I was met with skepticism.

In fact, derision.

Whether it's AI alone or AI plus humans, the level of creativity in entertainment and design will dramatically go up.

The level of diversity of these things will go up dramatically.

I'm excited about that.

Surprisingly, internet access will mostly be by agents.

Billions of agents running around doing things for us humans.

Medicine is my other favorite.

We have pretty good medicine today, but we have the practice of medicine, and it will change to the science of medicine.

It will change from what is mostly sick care today, we apply medicine when people are sick, to health care to prevent sickness.

It's a shame that in this day and age, most people who get a heart attack discover they have cardiac disease by having a heart attack, not 20 years earlier when that disease started.

That won't happen.

Food.

We will have new types of proteins, which we need, and new kinds of fertilizer essential to agriculture.

RuBisCO is the most prevalent protein on the planet.

Every place you see green, there is RuBisCO behind that chlorophyll, or almost everywhere.

There's a few exceptions.

And we will have much more environmentally better proteins than either plant proteins, and possibly better than corn and soy.

So I'm excited about that, and greener fertilizer.

Oh, my favorite.

Experts completely disagree with me when I say this.

We can, in the next 25 years, replace most cars in most cities.

Why? By making transit faster than a chauffeured car, cheaper than a public transit system and pervasive, any time on demand.

And yes, we can do it.

In fact, we are building the first one of these public transit systems in San Jose today.

Another one of these, flying at almost 4000 mph.

We will be able to fly from New York to London for lunch.

It will make the world a much closer place.

And we fret a lot about power, and we think solar and wind are the solution.

They're great solutions I've been advocating for the last 20 years.

But fusion power will replace most coal and natural gas power plants today.

Again, people say we can't build that many.

We can if we are smart, if we just replace their boilers, or maybe the boilers and their turbines.

In fact, all those plants will probably be retrofitted with fusion, possibly with superhot geothermal,
not the kind of geothermal you've heard about, even heard about at TED.

But much hotter, better, more efficient geothermal.

Doomers say we don't have enough resources like lithium and copper.

In fact, I say we haven't started to look.

In fact, we haven't started to develop the technologies that will let us look a kilometer below the surface.

We are well on our way, though.

There will be carbon solutions for everything.

Entrepreneurs are working on this.

There's only a dozen major emitter categories, and I wrote a blog on it about two years ago.

And it only takes one entrepreneur to tackle each of these categories, so a dozen instigators can change the world of climate.

In fact, we inaugurated last week the first cement plant in California which from the same amount of limestone produces twice the amount of cement by capturing the carbon dioxide and putting it into product.

You repurpose existing plants, upgrade them like you would coal plants and natural gas plants, and you increase the level of product while decreasing the cost per ton.

That's what makes these things scalable.

All we need is a few entrepreneurs who will imagine the impossible, dream the dreams, and then be foolish enough to make them come true.

There's lots of reasons this won't happen, but I won't delve into them.

But I do think a really abundant world is possible.

It only takes a few motivated, impassioned entrepreneurs to make it happen.

Thank you.

我是一个技术乐观主义者，
"但技术乐观主义应该
以同理心和关怀来实践。"
"我相信
如果你这样做的话，一切皆有可能。"
"首先，我要
警告你。"
专家们推断过去。
"他们阻止了激进的进步，
因为他们不非线性思考。"
他们不会考虑不可能的事情。
"我个人认为
只有不可能的事情才是重要的。"
"我们只是不知道
哪个不太可能的事情是重要的。"
"另一方面，企业家
怀着对愿景的热情，"
"他们梦想着梦想，
然后他们就足够愚蠢了，"
我们需要更多的愚蠢
"来尝试让那些
难以置信的梦想成真。"
"这就是创业精神，
也是我一生所热爱的。"
"这40年，我一直在做
创新，只做创新。"
这可能会让人们感到惊讶。
"我想不出有哪个
重大的社会影响变化"
是由该领域的专家推动的，
"可能除了
生物技术之外，"
"它是由专家、
大型机构、"
大型非创始人领导的公司推动的。
"想一想。
40年来，没有一个例子。"
"无论你看看 SpaceX、
电动汽车还是 Uber，"
没有一个例子。
"我最早能想到的
是 70 年代初的信用卡，"
"当时美国银行
将信用额度用于塑料信用卡。"
那么这个似是而非的世界是什么呢？
我将介绍十几个
"我相信
大多数专家都会嗤之以鼻的场景。"
人工智能支持的大多数专业知识将是免费的。
我最兴奋的是，
地球上的每个人都
可以
以非常广泛的方式获得 24/7 的免费医生和初级保健。
每个孩子都可以以
一种非常方便、方便的方式获得免费导师，
而且这些导师几乎是免费的。
没关系，其他专业知识，
"无论您是在寻找
结构工程师还是肿瘤学家，"
大多数专业知识都几乎是免费的。
计算成本。
大多数劳动力也将是免费的。
我可以想象十亿双足机器人
"所做的工作比
当今所有人类劳动力还要多，从而"
"将人类从
某些工作的奴役中解放出来。"
"在通用汽车的
装配线上工作，每天八小时，"
做同样的事情三十年。
那不是一份工作。 这几乎就是奴隶制。
我确实相信我们将有足够的资源
"来照顾每个
流离失所的人。"
"这就是
技术乐观主义的同理心部分发挥作用的地方。"
"我们将有足够的资源
来进行重新分配。"
编程也将接近免费。
"尽管我们今天认为计算机已经
普及，但"
我认为它们将会更加普遍、
更加普及和广泛。
"事实上，我认为我们会将
计算机视为一种实用工具。"
你们中有多少人想到了电？
"这就是它
在背景中的样子，而不是在我们面前的样子。"
"就像我手里的这个小兔子设备一样
，我们只需与它交谈即可。"
它会理解人类的指令。
计算机将适应人类。
"我们不必让
人类学习计算机。"
"五年前，当我第一次
在多伦多的一次会议上谈论"
"人工智能
在音乐生成中的作用时，"
我遭到了怀疑。
其实是嘲讽。
无论是单独的人工智能还是人工智能加人类，
"娱乐
和设计的创造力水平都将大幅提升。"
"这些事物的多样性水平
将急剧上升。"
我对此感到很兴奋。
"令人惊讶的是，互联网访问
主要由代理进行。"
"数十亿特工四处奔波，
为我们人类做事。"
医学是我的另一个最爱。
今天我们有相当好的医学，
但我们有医学实践，
"它将转变
为医学科学。"
"它将从
现在主要是"
生病时的医疗，转变
为医疗保健以预防疾病。
令人遗憾的是，在当今这个时代，
"大多数心脏病发作的人都是通过心脏病发作才
发现自己患有"
心脏病，而
"不是
在疾病开始的 20 年前。"
那不会发生。
食物。
"我们将拥有
我们所需的新型蛋白质，"
"以及
农业必需的新型肥料。"
"RuBisCO 是地球上最普遍的
蛋白质。 在"
"你看到绿色的每一个地方，
叶绿素后面都有RuBisCO，"
或者说几乎无处不在。
有一些例外。
"我们将拥有比植物蛋白更
环保的蛋白质"
，
甚至可能比玉米和大豆更好。
"所以我对此感到兴奋，
还有更环保的肥料。"
哦，我的最爱。 当我这么说时，
"专家们完全不同意
我的观点。"
在未来 25 年里，我们可以
更换大多数城市的大多数汽车。
"为什么？ 让交通
比专职司机更快、"
比公共交通系统更便宜
并且随需随叫随到。
是的，我们可以做到。
"事实上，我们今天正在圣何塞建设第一个
公共交通系统"
。
"其中另一架的
飞行速度接近 4000 英里/小时。"
"我们将能够
从纽约飞往伦敦吃午餐。"
"这将使世界变得
更加紧密。"
我们非常担心电力问题，
"我们认为太阳能和风能
是解决方案。"
它们是
"我
过去 20 年来一直倡导的出色解决方案。"
"但聚变发电将取代当今大多数煤炭
和天然气发电厂。"
"人们再次说
我们不能建造那么多。"
"如果我们聪明的话，
只要我们更换他们的锅炉，"
或者锅炉和涡轮机，我们就可以做到。
"事实上，所有这些发电厂都
可能会通过核聚变进行改造，"
可能会使用超热地热，而
"不是
你听说过的那种地热，"
甚至在 TED 上也听说过。
"但更热、更好、
更高效的地热能。"
"末日论者说我们没有
足够的资源，比如锂和铜。"
事实上，我说我们还没有开始寻找。
"事实上，我们还没有开始
开发"
"能够让我们观察
地表以下一公里的技术。"
不过，我们进展顺利。 一切
"都会有碳解决方案
。"
企业家们正在为此努力。
"
主要的发射器类别只有十几个，大约两年前"
"我写了一篇关于它的博客
。"
"只需要一位企业家
就能解决每一类问题，"
"因此十几位煽动者
就可以改变气候世界。"
事实上，我们上周
在加利福尼亚州开设了第一家水泥厂，通过捕获二氧化碳并将其转化为产品，用
"相同数量的石灰石
生产出两倍数量的水泥"
"
。"
您可以重新利用现有工厂，像升级
"
燃煤工厂和天然气工厂一样升级它们，"
并提高产品水平，
同时降低每吨成本。
这就是使这些东西具有可扩展性的原因。
我们所需要的只是一些企业家，
"他们能够想象不可能的事情，
梦想梦想，"
"然后愚蠢地
让它们成真。"
"有很多原因不会发生这种情况，
但我不会深入研究它们。"
"但我确实认为一个真正丰富的
世界是可能的。"
只需要一些有动力、
"充满热情的企业家
就能实现这一目标。"
谢谢。
