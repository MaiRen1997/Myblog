When I was in graduate school,there was a student who I looked up to.

graduate : 

1. n.大学毕业生，学士学位获得者；毕业生,
2. v.获得学位（尤指学士），大学毕业,
3. adj.（课程、学业）研究生的

`look up to.尊敬和钦佩（某人）：表示对某人的尊敬和钦佩`

His name was Peter.

Peter was the type of person you wanted to be like.

He was smart, articulate and **winsome**.

One day I saw Peter in the library.

It was his final quarter in our program and he **was about to** graduate.

`be about to 即将要做某事：表示某事即将发生或即将进行`

"Peter, congratulations.You must be so excited."

His response surprised me.

"I am, but I haven't built my network like I should have,so I don't have any jobs lined up yet."

line up:

1. 排队：指将人或物按照一定的顺序排列在一起。
2. 对齐：指将人或物摆放成一条直线或按照一定的规则排列。
3. 安排：指为某人或某事做准备或组织

His answer terrified me.

If someone as impressive as Peter didn't have a job lined up,then what was I to do?

As the son of two **immigrants**,education was the key to success.

immigrants: 移民

I could not afford to waste this opportunity.

I found myself feeling **anxious** and **fearful**.

fearful： 

1. adj.害怕的，担心的；可怕的；极坏的，极端的

I had to find a way to protect my career.

The **stakes** were too high for me to finish school without having a job lined up.

stakes：

1. n.赌注；风险（stake 的复数）；利益
2. v.用桩支撑；以……打赌（stake 的第三人称单数）

Then I remembered the advice I'd been given countless times.

Go network.Build relationships.After all, it's all about who you know, not what you know.

After all：毕竟

They were right.Education wasn't the highway of opportunity.

It was merely an on-ramp.

**"on-ramp"** 是高速公路或主要道路的入口匝道，常用于指代交通进入主路的斜坡。

**"merely"** 在这里表示“仅仅”或“只是”，用来强调它只是某件事的一个起点或开始。

- She is merely a beginner in this field
- It was merely a misunderstanding
- The book is not a novel, but merely a collection of essays

The highway of opportunity was social capital.

capital:资本，资金；资本家，资方；首都

social capital： 社会资本(指社交网络内部和之间的社交互动所创造的善意、同情和联系)

Your network,the people you know,and more importantly, the people who know you.

I was **determined**.

determined：

1. adj.下定决心的，坚决的

   v.决定，控制；查明，确定；下定决心（determine 的过去式和过去分词）

I set off to build a network that would **guarantee** my success.

set off 

1. 突出，凸显：通过对比使某物显得突出或凸显。
2. 补偿，抵消：用于抵消或补偿某种不利或不平衡的情况。
3. 出发，启程：开始进行一段旅程或行程

I spent as much time as I could building relationships with people who could hire me when I graduated.

The process worked. 这个过程起作用了

But it didn't feel right.

I was having the right conversations,I was meeting the right people.

**Internship** and job opportunities began to open up,but networking and building relationships began to feel **gross**.

Internship：n.实习生；实习期；实习医师的职位

open up： 出现

I was **approaching** people as a transactional consumer,not as a relational **investor**.

My driving question was focused on what can I get from this person?

How can they help me?

I was asking the wrong questions.

Networking was a necessary **evil**.

evil：

1. adj.恶毒的，邪恶的；有害的，易造成伤害的；讨厌的，令人不舒服的；恶魔的，不祥的
2. n.有害（或不受欢迎）的事；邪恶，罪恶；坏事，恶行

It felt **gross**.

**gross：**

1. **adj.总的，毛的；严重的，极端的；粗鲁的；肥胖难看的，臃肿的；大范围的，粗略的；（高尔夫球的得分）实际所得的；明显的；让人恶心的**
2. **adv.总共，全部**
3. **v.总共赚得**
4. **n.一罗（144个）；毛收入，总收入**

Then one day, the tables were turned. 

I saw a childhood acquaintance at a coffee shop.

**acquaintance， n相识的人，泛泛之交；认识，相识；所知，了解**

We started a conversation.

He then spent the entire time trying to convince me to join the multi-level marketing scheme that he was apart of.

**was apart of： 成为 ..... 的一部分**

(Laughter)
You see, the more people he signed up underneath him,the more money he would make.

But that's not all.

He'd help me build an empire as well.

**empire： n.帝国；大企业，大集团；君权，最高统治权**

In fact, I could make so much money, I would never need to work again.

I could give to my parents for all that they had given to me,  and all by simply helping people change their spending habitsand just begin to buy products from us,  products that they were already going to buy on their own anyways.

It was at that moment that I began to realize,if networking ever feels gross,you're doing it wrong.

It turns out that social scientists had studied what I've experienced.

**turn out:** 

1. **驱逐，翻转，大量生产，装备，打扮，关掉，召集**

In 2014, researchers from the University of Toronto,  Harvard and Northeastern teamed up to investigate

**team up	合作：与某人合作一起工作。联合：与其他组织一起合作。**

**investigate： v.侦察（某事）；调查（某人）；研究**

the impact of building social capital on people's sense of morality.

What they discovered across their work was that when people built relationships for selfish pursuits,

it left them feeling psychologically dirty and even morally stained.

**selfish pursuits：自私追求：指个人为了自己的利益而不顾及他人的行为或追求。**

**psychologically：adv.心理上地；心理学地**

Decades of research confirms the common advice about networking.

Building social capital leads to a host of positive outcomes: job performance,salary levels, employability and so much more.

**a host of： 许多的，大量的**

If you want to build your career or your business,then networking is a good strategy.

But here's the **dilemma**.

**dilemma: n.（进退两难的）窘境，困境；二难推理，两刀论法**

When people built relationships for selfish gain, it left them feeling dirty.

And when they felt dirty, they were even less likely **to engage with those people**
**and to build those relationships**.

**engage:**

1. **v.雇用，聘请；参加，从事；吸引，引起；与……交战，开战；（使）（机器）啮合，接合；<旧>预定（膳食，地方等）；适应，与……有密切关系；允诺，签约保证；（运动员或击剑手）使（兵器）交结在一起；占用**

Even though that might be exactly what they needed for their success in their careers.

**Even though: 尽管，虽然：用于加强说“虽然”的语气。**

There's a reason that I felt gross when I was approaching people as a transactional consumer,
instead of as a relational investor.

**approaching : v.接近（approach 的 ing 形式）；[航]进场；侵入**

**transactional : adj.交易型的；事务性的；事务处理的**

How do you do relationships in a way
that you don't feel like you need to **rinse off** after every coffee meeting?

rinse off： 冲洗，通过冲洗来清洁

I began to ask a different question.
Instead of "What can I get from this person?"
I began to ask, "What can I give to this person?"
Everything changed.
I discovered **generous** relational investors
who introduced me to a different **paradigm**,

paradigm：n.典范，范例；样板，范式；词形变化表；纵聚合关系语言项

a new way of doing relationships.
Jeff, a business leader in Seattle, was one of them.
If you ever sit with him for coffee,
you quickly realize his goal is to understand how he can serve you,
not how you can serve him.
This new **mindset** moved me from being a **greedy**,
transactional consumer to being a generous relational investor.

Relational investors leave people better than they found them.

leave: 使处于某种状态，留下，  而不是常用的离开

Leave people better： 表示投资者通过他们的行为、支持或努力，使得别人处于比之前更好的状态。它强调的是一个结果或影响，而不是字面上的“离开”某人

The goal isn’t giving to gain

be giving  to: 给予

or even about paying it forward
so that positive things circle back around for you one day.
Relational investors give out of the overflow of who they are
and what they've already been given.
They bring generosity beyond reciprocity.
They ask a different question.
Instead of "What can I get from this person?"
They ask, "What can I give to this person?"
It represents a mindset shift from fixating on pathology
to focusing on potential.
The human default is pathology.
Pathology is all about the barriers, the obstacles, the brokenness,
the things that are going wrong.
My PhD is in industrial and organizational psychology.
For decades,
psychology and many other human-centered disciplines
have focused on pathology.
What's broken?
How do we fix it?
Over the last 30 years,
there's been a revolution that's pushed against pathology, though,
and begun to look for potential.
What's working?
What's going well?
How do we make things even better?
It's a shift from scarcity to abundance.
And it starts with the assumption that there is possibility,
and there is potential to be realized.
Both are important.
We have to pay attention to barriers and limitations,
but we also need to recognize possibility and potential.
But our baseline
is self-preservation.
Protect my career.
Position myself for success.
When I became free from the fear of finding a job,
I was able to move from protecting my pathology
to looking for potential.
As the old saying goes,
it's even better to give than it is to receive.
And you don't have to be wealthy to be a relational investor.
I was a poor student.
I discovered that generous relational investors give their time,
their treasure and their talent.
Generosity looks different in different seasons of life.
It could be as simple as the gift of your undivided attention.
The next time you're meeting with somebody.
Or maybe it's a heartfelt thank-you note,
letting someone know you've appreciated how they have invested in you.
Perhaps it's a timely introduction.
You've built a relationship with somebody
and you know somebody else who would be mutually beneficial for them to meet.
So you make that connection.
Generosity could even look like helping a coworker who's behind on a deadline.
Taking a little extra time to help them get caught up.
It could even be as simple as the offer to review someone's resume for them.
The possibilities for generosity are only limited by your imagination.
Because people aren't a process.
People are the purpose.
And business is all about people.
It's not about extracting value or leveraging relationships.
It’s about building meaningful, generous and mutually beneficial relationships,
looking for ways to serve other people,
even if they are the ones who are helping you.
You might not get anything back right away,
or even at all.
But there's still value in the relationship
because every person has inherent dignity, value and worth,
regardless of the outcome.
Years after my conversation with Peter in the library,
I found myself working in a university helping lead a graduate business program.
I was meeting with a prospective student to learn about his goals.
He was a great candidate
and I really wanted him in our program.
But over the course of the conversation,
I began to realize what he was looking for
wasn't quite what I had to offer.
Reluctantly, I pointed him in a different direction.
A year later, I had another similar conversation
with a young woman who was also exploring our program.
She was incredible.
Her goals aligned with our training and she became one of our best students.
But it wasn't until after she started
when I discovered she had found out about our program
from the young man I'd met over a year before.
He had told her if she met with me,
I'd put her interests first.
And that if she wasn't the right fit,
I'd point her in the right direction.
Focusing on the interests of other people
can absolutely pay off for the long term.
But that's not the point.
There is nothing more rewarding than giving to other people.
My parents, they impressed the value of education on me,
but they also demonstrated the value of generosity.
They have been avid suburban gardeners
for over 40 years.
They started composting in Seattle before composting was the thing to do.
Every year I have watched them till the ground, fertilize,
prepare and plant seeds, water them
and care for their garden with great intent.
They do such an excellent job
that every year, they harvest so much produce,
there's absolutely no way they can possibly consume it all themselves.
They have so much that it will go to spoil.
It will go to waste.
So what do they do?
Instead of letting it go to spoil,
they spoil their friends.
They take all the excess.
They put it in bags and baskets,
and they generously share it with all of their friends and neighbors.
Most years,
they even take their extra seeds
to help friends start their own gardens for the following year.
Looking back, I realize, my parents didn't garden just for themselves.
Don't get me wrong,
they enjoyed the fresh fruit and produce,
but they had equal, if not greater, joy in giving to the people around them.
The relationships in their lives represented a place for giving,
not a vehicle for getting.
They showed me that you can get more than you give
by giving more than you get.
Our networks, our relationships
are also like a garden.
If we tend them well, they will grow and they will produce fruit.
So much, in fact,
there's absolutely no way we can possibly consume it all ourselves.
Instead of letting relationships go to waste,
we can invest in them,
give to them, serve them, connect them with each other.
When we give social capital,
we don't lose it.
It doesn't decrease.
It increases.
Who knows,
we might even help someone start their own garden.
Becoming a generous relational investor, it's a lifestyle.
It's a different paradigm of relationships.
So what's your relational posture?
Are you a greedy, transactional consumer
or a generous relational investor?
Are you protecting your pathology
or pushing for potential?
It's never too late to begin to ask a different question
and to start to look for what can I give,
not what can I get?
(Applause)

当我在读研究生时，
有一个我很敬佩的学生。
他的名字叫彼得。
"彼得是
你想成为的那种人。"
他很聪明，善于表达，而且很有魅力。
有一天我在图书馆见到彼得。
"这是他在我们项目的最后一个季度
，他即将毕业。"
“彼得，恭喜你。
你一定很兴奋吧。”
他的反应令我惊讶。
"“是的，但我还没有
像我应该的那样建立我的网络，"
所以我还没有任何工作机会。”
他的回答让我害怕。
"如果像彼得这样令人印象深刻的人
没有找到工作，"
那我该怎么办？
作为两个移民的儿子，
教育是成功的关键。
"我不能
浪费这个机会。"
"我发现自己感到
焦虑和恐惧。"
我必须找到一种方法来保护我的职业生涯。
"
对于我"
来说，在没有找到工作的情况下完成学业的风险太大了。
"然后我想起了
无数次给我的建议。"
走网络。
建立关系。
毕竟，重要的是你认识谁，而
不是你知道什么。
他们是对的。
"教育不是
机会的高速公路。"
这只是一个入口坡道。
"机会高速公路
是社会资本。"
你的网络，
你认识的人，
"更重要的是，
认识你的人。"
我下定决心。
"我开始建立一个
保证我成功的网络。"
"我花了尽可能多的时间与
"
毕业后可以雇用我的人建立关系。
这个过程奏效了。
但感觉不对。
我进行了正确的对话，
遇到了正确的人。
"实习和工作机会
开始出现，"
但建立人际网络和建立关系
开始让人感觉很恶心。
"我将人们
视为交易消费者，"
而不是关系投资者。
"我的主要问题集中
在我能从这个人那里得到什么？"
他们能如何帮助我？
我问了错误的问题。
网络是一种不可避免的罪恶。
感觉很恶心。
然后有一天，情况发生了逆转。
"我在一家咖啡店见到了儿时的熟人
。"
我们开始交谈。
"然后，他花了全部时间
试图说服我"
"加入他参与的多层次营销计划
。"
（笑声）
"你看，
他手下报名的人越多，"
他赚的钱就越多。
但这还不是全部。
他也会帮助我建立一个帝国。
"事实上，我可以赚这么多钱，
我再也不需要工作了。"
"我可以向我的父母回报
他们给予我的一切，"
"而这一切只需帮助人们
改变他们的消费习惯，"
并开始从我们这里购买产品，无论如何，
"他们已经
会自己购买的产品。"
"正是在那一刻，
我开始意识到，"
如果网络感觉很恶心，那么
你就做错了。
"事实证明，社会科学家
研究了我的经历。"
"2014年，
来自多伦多大学、"
"哈佛大学和东北大学的研究人员
联手调查了"
"建立社会资本
对人们道德感的影响。"
"他们在工作中发现，
当人们"
为了自私的追求而建立关系时，
会让他们感到心理上肮脏
，甚至道德上受到玷污。
"数十年的研究证实了
有关网络的常见建议。"
"建立社会资本会带来一系列
积极成果：工作绩效、"
"薪资水平、就业能力
等等。"
"如果您想发展
自己的职业生涯或业务，"
那么建立人际网络是一个很好的策略。
但这是一个两难的境地。
"当人们
为了自私的利益而建立关系时，"
他们会感到肮脏。
当他们感到肮脏时，
"他们就更不可能
与这些人交往"
并建立这些关系。
"尽管这可能正是
"
他们职业生涯成功所需要的。
-
"当我
作为交易消费者"
而不是关系投资者来接近人们时，我感到很恶心，这是有原因的。
你如何处理人际关系，
"而不是
每次咖啡会议后都觉得需要冲洗掉？"
我开始问一个不同的问题。
"而不是“我能从
这个人那里得到什么？”"
"我开始问：“我能给
这个人什么？”"
一切都变了。
我发现了慷慨的关系投资者，
他们向我介绍了一种不同的范式，
一种建立关系的新方式。 西雅图的
"一位商界领袖杰夫
就是其中之一。"
如果你曾经和他坐在一起喝咖啡，
"你很快就会意识到他的目标
是了解他如何为你服务，"
而不是你如何为他服务。
"这种新的心态使我
从一个贪婪的"
交易型消费者转变
为一个慷慨的关系投资者。
"关系型投资者留下的人
比他们发现时更好。 我们的"
目标不是为了获得利益而付出，
甚至不是为了将其回报下去，
"以便有一天积极的事情会
回到你身边。"
"关系型投资者的奉献
源于他们的身份"
和他们已经获得的东西。
他们带来的慷慨超越了互惠。
他们问了一个不同的问题。
"而不是“我能从
这个人那里得到什么？”"
"他们问：“我可以
给这个人什么？”"
"它代表了
从关注病理"
到关注潜力的思维转变。
人类的默认是病态的。
"病理学就是关于障碍、
障碍、破碎和"
出错的事情。
"我的博士学位是工业
和组织心理学。"
几十年来，
"心理学和许多其他以
人为中心的学科"
一直关注病理学。
什么坏了？
我们该如何解决它？ 然而，
在过去的 30 年里，
"发生了一场
反对病态的革命，"
并开始寻找潜力。
什么在起作用？
进展顺利吗？
我们如何让事情变得更好？
这是从稀缺到丰富的转变。
"它始于这样的假设：
存在可能性，"
并且有潜力被实现。
两者都很重要。
"我们必须关注
障碍和限制，"
"但我们也需要认识到
可能性和潜力。"
但我们的底线
是自我保护。
保护我的职业生涯。
为成功定位自己。
"当我摆脱了
对找工作的恐惧时，"
"我就能够
从保护自己的病态"
转向寻找潜力。
正如一句老话所说，
"给予
比接受更好。"
"而且你不必非常富有
才能成为关系投资者。"
我是一名贫困学生。
"我发现
关系投资者慷慨地奉献了他们的时间、"
财富和才能。
"慷慨
在人生的不同季节表现得不同。"
"它可以像
你全神贯注的礼物一样简单。"
"下次你
和某人见面的时候。"
或者也许这是一封衷心的感谢信，
"让别人知道你很感激
他们对你的投资。"
也许这是一个及时的介绍。
您已经与某人建立了关系，
"并且您认识其他人，
他们的见面对双方都有利。"
所以你建立了这种联系。
"慷慨甚至可能看起来像是帮助
一位未能按时完成任务的同事。"
"多花一点时间
帮助他们跟上进度。"
"它甚至可以像提议
为某人审查某人的简历一样简单。"
"慷慨的可能性
仅受您的想象力的限制。"
因为人不是一个过程。
人就是目的。
商业的本质就是人。
"这与提取价值
或利用关系无关。"
"这是关于建立有意义、慷慨
和互利的关系，"
寻找为他人服务的方法，
"即使他们是
在帮助你的人。"
"您可能不会
立即得到任何东西，"
甚至根本得不到任何东西。
"但这种关系仍然有价值，
"
"因为无论结果如何，每个人都有与生俱来的
尊严、价值和价值"
。
"在
图书馆与彼得交谈多年后，"
"我发现自己在一所大学工作，
帮助领导研究生商业项目。"
"我正在与一位未来的学生会面，
了解他的目标。"
他是一位出色的候选人
，我真的希望他加入我们的项目。
但在谈话过程中，
我开始意识到他正在寻找的东西
并不完全是我所能提供的。
"我无奈地给他指了
另一个方向。"
"一年后，我与一位也在探索我们项目的年轻女士进行了另一次
类似的对话"
"
。"
她太不可思议了。
"她的目标与我们的培训一致
，她成为我们最好的学生之一。"
但直到她开始工作后，
"我才发现她是
"
"从我一年多前认识的那个年轻人那里了解到我们的项目的
。"
他告诉她，如果她见到我，
我会把她的利益放在第一位。
如果她不合适，
我会给她指出正确的方向。
关注他人的利益
绝对可以带来长期回报。
但这不是重点。
"没有什么
比给予他人更有价值的了。"
"我的父母，他们给我留下了
教育的价值，"
"但他们也展示了
慷慨的价值。  40 多年来，"
他们一直是狂热的郊区园丁
。 在堆肥成为现实之前，
"他们就开始在西雅图进行堆肥
。"
"每年我都会看着他们
耕地、施肥、"
准备和种植种子、浇水
"并全神贯注地照料他们的花园
。"
他们的工作非常出色
"，每年都会收获
如此多的农产品，"
"他们
自己绝对不可能全部吃完。"
"他们拥有太多，
以至于会变质。"
它将被浪费。
那么他们做什么呢？ 他们
不会让它毁掉，而是
毁掉他们的朋友。
他们拿走了所有多余的东西。
他们把它放在袋子和篮子里，
"并慷慨地
与所有的朋友和邻居分享。"
大多数时候，
他们甚至会带着多余的种子
"来帮助朋友在来年开办自己的花园
。"
"回想起来，我意识到，我的父母
不仅仅是为了自己而园艺。"
不要误会我的意思，
他们喜欢新鲜的水果和农产品，
"但他们在为周围的人提供帮助时也有同样的、甚至更大的快乐
。"
"他们生活中的关系
代表了给予的场所，"
而不是获取的工具。
"他们告诉我，
"
只要付出多于得到，你就能得到比付出更多的东西。
我们的网络、我们的关系
也像一个花园。
"如果我们照顾得好，它们就会生长
并结出果实。"
事实上，
"
我们绝对不可能自己把它全部吃完。 我们"
"不应该让
关系白白浪费，而"
应该投资它们、
"给予它们、服务它们、将
它们彼此联系起来。"
当我们给予社会资本时，
我们不会失去它。
它并没有减少。
它增加了。
谁知道呢，
"我们甚至可能帮助某人
建立自己的花园。"
"成为一名慷慨的
关系投资者，这是一种生活方式。"
"这是一种不同
的关系范式。"
那么你们的关系姿势是怎样的呢？
您是贪婪的交易型消费者
还是慷慨的关系投资者？
你是在保护自己的病态
还是激发潜力？
"开始
提出不同的问题"
并开始寻找我能给予什么，而
不是我能得到什么，永远不会太晚。
（掌声）
