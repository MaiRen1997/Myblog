Just the other day, I was having this casual coffee chat with a friend and he asked me, "Am I going to be replaced by AI?

I don't want to go back to school to learn new skills, I'm 40.

And even if I do, won't employers prefer to hire someone half my age?"

I mean, I get his concern and I have many other friends and clients who’ve been asking me similar questions.

To be very honest, sometimes I worry about it too.

You see, I'm a consultant and consultants like me are famous, or some of you may even say infamous, for creating these extensive, deeply researched, well-polished slide decks.

But you know what?

We take great pride in this ability.

But what took us days and sometimes weeks in the past can now increasingly be done in a matter of hours, thanks to AI.

And well, this sort of thing is happening all over the economic landscape.

One in every three workers globally will find their jobs significantly impacted due to technology in this decade.

And that's not just bank tellers, factory workers and warehouse staff, but executive managers and office workers too.

You and me and all of us.

That's going to be more than one billion people impacted.

And companies can't hire their way through this problem.

Firstly, there just isn't enough talent in growing areas such as data science, cybersecurity or clean energy.

And even if companies managed to somehow hire their absolute best talent, in five years, half of their skills will become redundant.

Two and a half years, if you’re working in technology.

This is what we call the half life of skills.

The only solution is to reskill millions of people every year and get them to use those new skills to transition into new occupations.

But as I say this, I do realize this is going to be a profoundly complex societal challenge and so big, that governments, companies and individuals must -- together.

They must work together.

I am confident that the only way forward is to replace our fear and our skepticism with curiosity and optimism.

And I know this is possible because of my experience working with the Singapore government on one of their largest digital reskilling programs.

Singapore is a tiny country, barely visible on the world map and devoid of any major natural resources.

But they realized early on that the only way to grow the nation is to grow its people.

And since then, they have embraced reskilling so excitedly that if you visit Singapore, you're likely going to be bumping into skills ambassadors at shopping malls, talking excitedly about the impact of adult skill building through gamified interactive kiosks.

They share positive stories of reskilling on national news, and they even talk about reskilling as part of the national defense agenda against threats and challenges to the economy.

There was even a "lifelong learning" float at Singapore's National Day parade this year.

Unusual, isn't it, to see a country take such a positive and proactive approach?

But it was no surprise for me that in 2020, during record unemployment, the government reached out to my company to ask if we could take a few unemployed workers as interns.

But that conversation quickly spiraled into something much bigger.

And soon we were working jointly to launch an at-scale, six-month program called "Rise" to reskill thousands of individuals from traditional declining roles into roles such as data scientists, digital product owner and digital marketeer.

But ...

As applications to our program increased, so did my nervousness.

Many of our applicants had been out of formal education for more than 20 years.

We had Simon, a 53-year-old from the construction sector who survived two economic crises, to realize that he now wants to get into a digital career.

We had Hafizah, who spent more than seven months looking for her perfect job, to realize that she needed new skills to pivot away from the traditional media industry that she worked in, which was getting impacted by technology.

As I spoke to many of our learners, it was clear to me that this was not going to be an easy transition for them.

So right from the first week, we focused not just on building their skill set, but building their mindset
and building their confidence in their ability to reskill and make a career pivot happen.

And this is when we taught them skills such as first principles problem solving, a strategy we consultants use to solve some of our client's difficult problems.

First principles problem solving is challenging assumptions to identify the real problem to be solved, and then looking at issues from multiple fresh perspectives, even when you may not have deep subject matter expertise to begin with, and then distilling the core insight in a concise way.

These first principles problem solving skills would prepare our learners to thrive in these unfamiliar situations they will find themselves in in these new job domains.

And then to teach them the digital or the technology skills, we had to make things very, very real and practical for our mature learners.

So we put their skills in action on real projects.

And this is where we invited executives from companies like Olam, Danone and Singapore Airlines to host hackathons.

I still remember one of the hackathon showcases
where our "Rise" learners
presented the deep user research they did,
and the mock up of the digital app that they were recommending.

One of the client professionals got so excited and he told them,
"This is like professional consulting work."

I sat there smiling cheek to cheek,
because I knew that if these learners had applied for jobs,
their applications would have been screened out even in the very first stage.

And yet, more than 80 percent of our learners found jobs.

Our friend Simon,
he got hired as a digital project manager in In-Shore Tech.

And Hafiza,
she works as a digital marketing specialist
in [a] cyber security company.

Every time somebody from our program found a job,
we felt like proud parents.

Such bliss, I tell you.

But the government of Singapore had an important role to play
in the success of programs like "Rise."

They created a national job database
and they incentivized companies to hire such reskilled talent.

They're even steering academia to transition from higher education
to continuous learning.

And they have so successfully changed the narrative from fear to curiosity
that in 2021 alone,
more than 660,000 individuals
and more than 24,000 companies
participated in their programs.

And if you thought Singapore was unique, we are not the only ones.

Italy, Spain, India and many other countries
are launching similar skilling initiatives.

But beyond the role of governments,
companies play an important part
to shift this mindset from skepticism
to optimism for reskilling.

Take Ikea, the global furniture player.
In 2021,
Ikea launched this AI bot they call Billy
to manage majority of their routine customer inquiries.
But hold on a second.

What would happen to all those call center employees?

Would they lose their jobs?

No.

This is where Ikea chose to take a revolutionary approach,
and they actually ended up reskilling more than 8,500 individuals
who were call center employees
into interior design consultants to provide new,
personalized design services to their customers.

And the best part of this story
is that Ikea won the hearts and the minds
of its employees and customers,
but made an incremental sales
of more than 1.4 billion dollars in 2022 alone.

Now ultimately beyond governments and companies,
the real change must come from all of us.

I've been trying to invest in my own skills
and not worry too much about my pretty slides and AI,
and to model the lifelong learning behavior to my six-year-old.

He has this piggy bank that we call "my learning bank"
to save money to learn new skills.

Very recently, we used our savings on a course for robotics for kids.
He just loves building things, I tell you.

And he was very, very excited to show off the giraffe that he had built
that could walk step by step.

And step by step is all we need to embrace the reskilling revolution.

Job evolution due to technology is just going to be this new reality
of the world we have to live in.

But we must embrace this not with fear and with skepticism, but with curiosity and optimism for building our skills again and again.

Thank you.
(Applause)

"就在前几天，
我和一位朋友喝咖啡闲聊时，"
他问我：
“我会被人工智能取代吗？
"我不想回到学校
学习新技能，我已经 40 岁了。”"
"即使我这样做了，雇主难道不会更愿意
雇用年龄只有我一半的人吗？”"
我的意思是，我得到了他的关心，
"而且我还有很多其他朋友和客户也
一直在问我类似的问题。"
"说实话，
有时候我也担心这个问题。"
"你看，我是一名顾问，
像我这样的顾问"
"
因创建这些广泛的、"
"深入研究的、
精心打磨的幻灯片而闻名，或者你们中的一些人甚至可能会说臭名昭著。"
但你知道吗？
我们对这种能力感到非常自豪。
"但由于人工智能，过去需要几天
甚至几周的时间"
"现在可以
在几个小时内完成。"
"嗯，这种事情在
整个经济领域都在发生。"
全球每三个工人中就有一个
"会发现他们的工作
"
在这十年中因技术而受到重大影响。
"这不仅包括银行出纳员、
工厂工人和仓库工作人员，"
"还包括执行经理
和办公室职员。"
你和我以及我们所有人。
"这将有
超过十亿人受到影响。"
"公司无法
通过招聘来解决这个问题。"
"首先，
数据科学、"
网络安全或清洁能源等不断发展的领域缺乏足够的人才。
即使公司设法以
"某种方式聘请到
绝对最优秀的人才，"
五年后，
"他们的一半技能
将变得多余。"
"
如果您从事技术工作，则需要两年半。"
"这就是我们所说的
技能的半衰期。"
"唯一的解决方案是每年对数百万人进行重新培训，
"
"让他们利用这些新技能
过渡到新的职业。"
但正如我所说，我确实意识到
"这将是一个极其
复杂的社会挑战，"
"而且如此巨大，政府、公司
和个人必须共同努力。"
他们必须共同努力。
"我相信，前进的唯一出路
就是用好奇和乐观取代我们的恐惧"
和怀疑
。
我知道这是可能的，
"因为我
与新加坡政府合作开展"
"其最大的
数字再培训计划之一的经验。"
新加坡是一个很小的国家，
在世界地图上几乎看不见，
并且缺乏任何主要的自然资源。
"但他们很早就意识到，
国家发展的唯一途径"
是人民的发展。
"从那时起，他们就
如此兴奋地接受了重新技能培训，"
以至于如果您访问新加坡，
"您很可能会
在购物中心遇到技能大使，他们兴奋"
"地谈论
"
通过游戏化互动亭培养成人技能的影响。
"他们
在国家新闻中分享有关再培训的积极故事，"
甚至将再培训
视为国防议程的一部分，
"以应对经济面临的威胁和挑战
。 今年新加坡国庆阅兵上"
甚至还有“终身学习”花车
"
。"
"看到一个国家采取如此积极
主动的做法，不是很不寻常吗？"
但对我来说，毫不奇怪的是，
在2020年失业率创纪录的时期，
"政府联系
我的公司，询问"
"我们是否可以收一些失业
工人作为实习生。"
"但那次谈话很快就演变
成了更大的事情。"
"很快，我们共同
启动了一项"
名为“Rise”的大规模、为期六个月的计划，
"旨在将数千名个人
从传统的日渐衰退的角色转变"
为数据科学家、
"数字产品所有者
和数字营销人员等角色。"
但是……
随着我们项目申请的增加，
我的紧张感也随之增加。
"我们的许多申请者已经
脱离正规教育"
超过 20 年了。
"西蒙 (Simon) 53 岁，
来自建筑行业，"
经历了两次经济危机，他
"意识到自己现在想
进入数字化职业。"
哈菲扎花了
"七个多月的时间
寻找完美的工作，她"
意识到她需要新的技能
"来摆脱
她所工作的传统媒体行业，因为"
该行业正在受到技术的影响。
当我与许多学习者交谈时，
"我很清楚这
对他们来说并不是一个容易的过渡。"
因此，从第一周开始，
"我们不仅专注
于培养他们的技能，"
还培养他们的心态，
"并建立
他们对重新学习技能"
和实现职业转型的能力的信心。 正是在这个时候，
我们教给他们
诸如解决问题的第一原则等技能，这是
"我们顾问用来解决
客户的一些难题的策略。"
"第一原则问题解决
是挑战假设，"
以确定要解决的真正问题，
"然后
从多个新的角度看待问题，"
"即使您一开始可能没有深厚的
主题专业知识，"
"然后
以简洁的方式提炼出核心见解 。"
"这些解决问题的首要原则
将使我们的学习者做好准备，"
"在这些新的工作领域中发现自己不熟悉的情况下茁壮成长
"
。
"然后，为了教他们数字
或技术技能，"
"我们必须
为成熟的学习者提供非常非常真实和实用的东西。"
"因此，我们将他们的技能
运用到实际项目中。"
"我们邀请了
奥兰、"
"达能和新加坡航空等公司的高管
来举办黑客马拉松。"
"我仍然记得
一场黑客马拉松展示，"
我们的“Rise”学习者
展示了他们所做的深入用户研究，
"以及他们推荐的数字应用程序的模型
。"
"一位客户专业人士
非常兴奋，他告诉他们，"
"“这就像专业的
咨询工作。”"
我坐在那儿面带微笑，
"因为我知道，如果这些学员
去求职，"
"他们的申请
在第一阶段就会被筛选掉。"
"然而，超过 80%
的学习者找到了工作。"
我们的朋友西蒙，
"他被聘为
In-Shore Tech 的数字项目经理。"
Hafiza 是
一家网络安全公司的数字营销专家。
"每当
我们项目中的某人找到工作时，"
我们都感到像自豪的父母一样。
我告诉你，这样的幸福。
"但新加坡政府在
"
“崛起”等项目的成功中发挥着重要作用。
他们创建了一个全国性的就业数据库，
"并激励公司
雇用此类重新技能化的人才。"
"他们甚至引导学术界
从高等教育过渡"
到持续学习。
"他们成功地将人们的
看法从恐惧转变为好奇，"
仅 2021 年就有
超过 660,000 名个人
和超过 24,000 家公司
参与了他们的项目。
"如果您认为新加坡是独一无二的，那么
我们并不是唯一的。"
"意大利、西班牙、印度
和许多其他国家"
"正在启动类似的
技能计划。"
但除了政府的作用之外，
公司在将
这种心态从怀疑态度转变为
对再培训的乐观态度方面发挥着重要作用。 以
全球家具制造商宜家为例。
2021 年，
宜家推出了这款名为 Billy 的人工智能机器人，
"用于管理大部分
日常客户咨询。"
但等一下。
"所有这些
呼叫中心员工会发生什么？"
他们会失去工作吗？
不。
"这就是宜家选择
采取革命性方法的地方，"
"他们实际上最终将
8,500 多名"
呼叫中心员工重新培训
"为室内设计顾问，
为客户提供新的"
"个性化设计服务
。"
这个故事最精彩的部分
是，宜家赢得了
员工和顾客的心，
而且仅 2022 年就实现了
"超过 14 亿
美元的增量销售额。"
"现在最终超越了
政府和公司，"
真正的改变必须来自我们所有人。
"我一直在努力
投资自己的技能，"
"而不是太担心
我漂亮的幻灯片和人工智能，"
"并
为我六岁的孩子建立终身学习行为模型。"
"他有一个存钱罐，
我们称之为“我的学习银行”，"
可以省钱学习新技能。
"最近，我们用积蓄开设了
儿童机器人课程。"
我告诉你，他只是喜欢建造东西。
"他非常非常兴奋地展示了
他制作的"
可以一步一步行走的长颈鹿。
"我们需要一步一步地
拥抱再培训革命。"
"技术带来的工作演变
将成为"
我们必须生活的世界的新现实。
"但我们必须怀着好奇和乐观的态度来接受这一点，而不是
带着恐惧和怀疑，"
而是一次
又一次地培养我们的技能。
谢谢。
