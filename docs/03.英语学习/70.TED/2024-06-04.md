and I had this fabulous birthday party being planned, right?	"我正在计划举办一场精彩的生日
派对，对吧？"
Chicago, penthouse on a lake.	芝加哥，湖边的顶层公寓。
It was going to be gorgeous.	这将会是非常华丽的。
And this is from that photo shoot.	这是那张照片的拍摄结果。
(Laughter)	（笑声）
You had to have a photo shoot.	你必须拍张照片。
So I ordered these contacts	所以我订购了这些隐形眼镜，
because, you know, I'm going without glasses,	"因为，你知道，
我将不戴眼镜，"
but the contacts never come.	但隐形眼镜永远不会到来。
So I show up to the party, no contacts, no glasses.	"所以我出现在聚会上，
没有隐形眼镜，没有眼镜。"
I can't see a doggone thing.	我看不到任何狗屎的东西。
(Laughter)	（笑声）
A for effort, but it was definitely a failed mission.	"A代表努力，但这
绝对是一次失败的任务。"
Nonetheless, here I am in my 40s	尽管如此，我已经 40 多岁了，
with my stylish but indispensable Coke bottles,	"带着时尚
但不可或缺的可乐瓶，"
helping me to see clearly	帮助我看得清楚，
so that I'm not a danger to myself or anybody else.	"这样我就不会对
自己或其他人构成危险。"
Beyond wanting to share a picture of me as an adorable child	"除了想分享我
作为一个可爱的孩子的照片"
or reminisce on my youth gone by,	或回忆我逝去的青春之外，
all this talk about seeing reminds me of a very widely known	"所有这些关于观看的讨论都
让我想起了一个广为人知"
but misunderstood concept: empathy.	但被误解的概念：同理心。
See, I've been studying empathy for the last 15 years.	"看，过去 15 年我一直在研究同理心
。"
And at its core, empathy is how we see plus what we see.	"从本质上讲，同理心
是我们如何看待事物以及我们所看到的事物。"
How we see is rooted in our personal experience.	"我们如何看待事物植根
于我们的个人经历。"
It's subjective.	这是主观的。
What we see is more objective.	我们看到的更加客观。
It is a physical observation of a moment, a circumstance,	"它是对
某个时刻、一种情况、"
a condition that invites us to act in some particular way.	"一种条件的物理观察，促使我们
以某种特定的方式采取行动。"
How we see, on the contrary,	相反，我们的看法
is more rooted in our personal beliefs and our value system,	"更多地植根于我们的个人信仰
和价值体系，"
and perhaps our technical knowledge,	也许还有我们的技术知识，
all of which may vary from person to person.	"所有这些都可能
因人而异。"
I've learned over the years	多年来我了解到，
that earnest attempts at doing empathy the right way	"认真尝试以
正确的方式表达同理心"
can still land us in the wrong place.	仍然可能使我们陷入错误的境地。
While working on my PhD,	在攻读博士学位期间，
I was a full-time eighth grade math teacher	"我是芝加哥南区的一名全职
八年级数学老师"
on the South Side of Chicago.	。
So I would teach all day,	所以我会整天教课，
I would go to class and I would study all night.	"去上课，
然后整夜学习。"
Zero out of ten, do not recommend.	十分之零，不推荐。
(Laughter)	（笑声）
I was always tired.	我总是很累。
Anyway, I remember my first semester of graduate school	"不管怎样，我记得我
在研究生院的第一个学期"
taking a class and reading a paper	上课并阅读了艾琳·奥布莱恩（Eileen O'Brien）写的一篇
called "The Political is Personal" by Eileen O'Brien.	"名为《政治是个人的》的论文
。"
In the paper, O'Brien describes white anti-racists	"在论文中，奥布莱恩描述了
白人反种族主义者"
who have a really difficult time building relationships	"很难
"
with the people of color that they aim to help.	"与
他们想要帮助的有色人种建立关系。"
O'Brien insists that white folks and people of color	"奥布莱恩坚持认为，美国的白人
和有色人种之间"
in the United States are separated by this wide perception gap.	"存在着
巨大的认知差距。"
So white folks sort of think about racism as ending in 1960s	"因此，白人认为
种族主义在 20 世纪 60 年代就已经结束，"
and therefore see people of color as complaining and overreacting.	"因此认为有色人种
抱怨和反应过度。"
But people of color see continued racial discrimination.	"但有色人种看到
种族歧视依然存在。"
O'Brien is helping the reader to notice a fundamental divergence in perspective	"奥布莱恩正在帮助读者注意到
观点上的根本分歧，"
that she describes as false empathy,	她
borrowing from heralded legal scholar Richard Delgado.	"借用著名法律
学者理查德·德尔加多的说法，将其描述为错误的同理心。"
Essentially, false empathy is the failure of the empathizer	"从本质上讲，错误的共情
是共情者未能"
to see eye-to-eye with the individual for whom they aim to empathize.	"与
他们想要共情的人达成一致。"
These white anti-racists really thought of themselves	"这些白人反种族主义者确实
认为自己"
as more empathetic than they really were.	比实际情况更有同情心。
In fact, the people of color they aimed to help	"事实上，
他们旨在帮助的有色人种根本"
did not receive their benevolence and charity as help at all.	"没有得到他们的善意
和慈善帮助。"
And in turn, these white anti-racists developed feelings of discontent	"反过来，这些白人反种族主义者
产生了不满"
and frustration	和沮丧的感觉，
that O'Brien then describes as evidence of their false empathy.	"奥布莱恩随后将其描述
为他们错误同理心的证据。"
Now, I remember reading that paper and thinking	"现在，我记得读过
那篇论文，并思考了"
a lot about my white colleagues who I taught with at the time in Chicago.	"很多关于
我当时在芝加哥教书的白人同事的事。"
According to the National Center for Education Statistics,	"根据国家
教育统计中心的数据，"
white folks make up about 80 percent of the teacher workforce,	"白人约占
教师队伍的 80%，"
while US student populations become increasingly diverse.	"而美国学生群体也
日益多元化。"
Less than 50 percent of all K-12 students are being identified as white.	"所有 K-12 学生中不到 50% 的人
被认定为白人。"
This really made me wonder if empathy, or perhaps false empathy,	"这真的让我想知道同理心，
或者也许是错误的同理心，是否"
could explain why my colleagues had such a difficult time	"可以解释为什么我的同事们
很难与黑人学生"
building positive,	建立积极、
substantive relationships with their Black students.	"实质性的关系
。"
I watched as Black boys,	我看到那些
who needed more patience and more care,	需要更多耐心和更多关怀的黑人男孩
be mislabeled as disengaged and disinterested learners.	"被错误地贴上了不投入
和无兴趣的学习者的标签。"
Now a young person who refuses to take off their headphones,	"现在，一个年轻人
拒绝摘下耳机，"
that's what we see.	这就是我们所看到的。
Making sense of the reasons why	理解其中的原因
is how we see.	就是我们如何看待。
We need both to drive what we do,	我们需要两者来推动我们所做的事情，
because empathy is best expressed in the doing.	"因为同理心最好
在做事中表达。"
Like the white anti-racist in the O'Brien study,	"就像奥布莱恩研究中的白人反种族主义者一样
，"
these teachers relationships tended to be fragile at best,	"这些教师的关系
充其量也往往是脆弱的，"
and too often nonexistent	而且
with a group of kids who desperately needed positive adult interactions.	"与一群迫切
需要积极的成人互动的孩子们之间的关系往往是不存在的。"
Now, I’m talking about education.	现在，我正在谈论教育。
But all of us, no matter what your industry,	"但我们所有人，无论从事
什么行业，"
on a quest to become a good and kind human being,	"在追求成为一个善良
善良的人的过程中，"
must stop to notice if false empathy is driving our interactions	"都必须停下来注意错误的同理心是否正在
推动我们"
with diverse others.	与不同的人的互动。
OK, so I have to give you a few examples.	好的，所以我必须给你举几个例子。
False empathy is thinking you know more about other people's problems	"错误的同理心是认为你比别人更了解
别人的问题"
than they do.	。
It’s like meeting somebody from Flint, Michigan and saying,	"这就像遇到
来自密歇根州弗林特的人并说："
"Oh my God, I know what it's like not to have something you need"	"“天哪，我知道
没有你需要的东西是什么感觉”，而"
when you've never been without clean water.	"你从未
没有过干净的水。"
Not having something you need	没有你需要的东西
is not exactly the same thing as not having clean water.	"
与没有干净的水并不完全相同。"
False empathy is like putting on your superhero cape.	"错误的同理心就像穿上
你的超级英雄斗篷。"
We see somebody in pain, we rush into action,	"我们看到有人在痛苦中，
我们立即采取行动，"
shrouded in the spectacle of it all,	笼罩在这一切的景象中，
without ever stopping to query the source of their distress.	"却从未停下来询问
他们痛苦的根源。"
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,	我讨厌传递坏消息，
but sometimes saving them	但有时拯救他们
may be more about you than it is about them.	"可能更多的是关于你
而不是关于他们。"
And false empathy is egotistical.	错误的同理心是自私的。
It is self-centered.	这是以自我为中心的。
I love crab legs.	我喜欢蟹腿。
(Laughter)	（笑声）
Can I just be honest?	我可以说实话吗？
I love seafood.	我喜欢海鲜。
But false empathy is thinking I'm doing a really good thing	"但错误的同理心是认为
我"
by going to my favorite restaurant	去我最喜欢的餐馆
and getting a pound of juicy crab legs	买了一磅多汁的蟹腿
to take to a partner who has a shellfish allergy.	"给对
贝类过敏的伴侣，这是一件非常好的事情。"
Or buying an expensive gift for a child	或者给孩子买一份昂贵的礼物，
who would much rather have your attention on the couch after a long day.	"他更愿意
在漫长的一天后让你的注意力集中在沙发上。"
I could go on, but what I'm trying to say	我可以继续说下去，但我想说的
is that false empathy represents a conflict in perspective,	"是，错误的同理心代表了
观点冲突，"
and an earnest intention at anti-racism	反种族主义
and helping others	和帮助他人的真诚意图并
does not guarantee that your action will lead to the intended outcome,	"不能保证你的行动
会带来预期的结果，"
or that we will achieve the relationships	或者我们 将建立
that we all need to thrive.	我们所有人蓬勃发展所需的关系。
I've learned in my research with teachers	我在对那些表现出
who demonstrate evidence of empathy with Black boys	"
对黑人男孩表现出同理心的老师的研究中了解到，"
that they don't wake up every day aiming to be empathetic.	"他们并不是
每天醒来都旨在表现出同理心。"
They try things, they fail, and they make mistakes.	"他们尝试一些事情，他们失败，
他们犯错误。"
They exercise humility and they try something else.	"他们保持谦逊，
并尝试其他事情。"
Some researchers might refer to that as perspective taking,	"一些研究人员可能将
其称为观点采择，"
which is the ability to spontaneously adopt	"即
自发采纳"
the psychological point of view of others.	他人心理观点的能力。
So we know that perspective taking	所以我们知道，换位思考可以
substantially improves student-teacher relationships.	"极大地改善
师生关系。"
That Black boys, who are otherwise cast aside,	"
在其他情况下被抛弃的黑人男孩在有证据表明观点采择的"
feel seen and heard in classrooms	课堂上感到被看到和听到
where there is evidence of perspective taking,	"
，"
in part because their teachers take a lot of care	"部分原因是他们的老师
非常小心地为他们的问题"
to develop innovative and proactive solutions to their problems.	"制定创新和主动的
解决方案。"
We know that perspective taking	我们知道，换位思考
can reduce instances of exclusionary discipline,	"可以减少
排斥性纪律的情况，"
which is an issue that is particularly salient for Black kids.	"这
对黑人孩子来说尤其突出。"
And we know that empathy training can reduce implicit bias.	"我们知道同理心训练
可以减少隐性偏见。"
So imagine for a second	因此，想象一下，
you come across someone who appears to be sad	"您遇到一个
看起来很悲伤的人"
and you want to offer them some support,	，您想为他们提供一些支持，
or you have a friend who approaches you for advice	"或者您有一个朋友
向您寻求有关"
on an issue for which you have some familiarity.	"
您熟悉的问题的建议。"
If you want to avoid false empathy, perhaps you start by stopping.	"如果你想避免错误的同理心，
也许你可以从停止开始。"
Stop to observe the moment, right?	停下来观察一下这一刻，对吧？
Empathy requires heightened sensitivity to our ego.	"同理心需要
对我们的自我高度敏感。"
We all have an ego.	我们都有一个自我。
We just don't want that ego over determining how we see.	"我们只是不想让自我
过度决定我们的看法。"
So we have to learn to decenter ourselves as we listen.	"因此，我们必须学会
在倾听时保持自己的中心位置。"
Listening is an art.	倾听是一门艺术。
It's a discipline, but it's also an act of perspective taking.	"这是一门纪律，也是
一种换位思考的行为。"
We listen so that we can ask meaningful questions,	"我们倾听是为了提出
有意义的问题、"
engage in discourse,	参与讨论、
exercise humility and simply be present.	保持谦逊并保持在场。 如果没有换位思考，
We cannot do empathy without perspective taking.	"我们就无法产生同理心
。"
And finally, we have to do something.	最后，我们必须做点什么。
We have to act.	我们必须采取行动。
But we should not expect that just because we acted	"但我们不应该
仅仅因为我们采取了行动就指望"
that it's going to be the right thing.	这会是正确的事情。
The feedback we get from that action	我们从该行动中获得的反馈
should drive our subsequent interactions.	应该推动我们后续的互动。
On the journey to understanding and interpretation,	"在理解
和解释的过程中，"
it's a lot like our natural eyes.	它很像我们的自然眼睛。
It grows with time.	它随着时间的推移而增长。
As I grow older, my eyes evolve.	随着年龄的增长，我的眼睛也在进化。
That's what we'll call it.	这就是我们所说的。
They evolve.	他们不断进化。
And so I have to go, and I have to see the optometrist,	"所以我必须走了，
我必须去看验光师，"
and I sit in front of that contraption	我坐在那个装置前面，
as they move the different lenses to check the clarity of my sight.	"他们移动不同的镜片
来检查我视力的清晰度。"
They're doing that because they want to make sure	"他们这样做是
因为他们希望确保"
that how and what I see helps me to act	我所看到的方式和内容能够帮助我采取行动，让
in a way that will make the world a better place	"
世界"
as I move through it.	在我走过的过程中变得更加美好。
Empathy is a lot like that prescription.	同理心很像那个处方。
So the next time you want to help,	因此，下次当你想要帮助、
you want to heal,	想要治愈、
you want to support or simply show up for someone,	"想要支持
或只是出现在某人面前时，"
try to make sure you're seeing with the right eyes.	"请尝试确保你
用正确的眼光来看待。"
Thank you.	谢谢。
(Applause)	（掌声）
