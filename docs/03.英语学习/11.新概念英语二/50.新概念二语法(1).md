## 双宾语动词

give, teach, buy, lend, make, hand, sell, show, read, pay, find, offer, pass, bring等

1. give/teach

   give(teach) sb. sth.
   give(teach) sth. `to` sb.

2. buy/make

   buy(make) sb. sth.
   buy(make) sth.`for` sb.

## 双宾语被动

## 名词所有格

名词所有格表示所属关系，有两种形式：一般情况下，

1. “-’s”用于有生命的名词，
2. of 用于无生命的名词

### -S 结构

1. 一般情况下，在单数名词的词尾直接加`'s`。

   Jim’s football

   Jenny’s dress

2. 以-s结尾的复数名词，只能在词尾加  `'`

   the `students’ books`

   the `workers’ club`

3. `不以s结尾的不规则复数名词`，还得在词尾加`'s'`

   Children’s Day

   men’s shoes

4. 若表示`两人各自所有的两个东西`，则应在`两个名词后面都加上's`，`且后接复数名词`；

   若表示`两人共同所有的一个东西`，则`只能在后面那个名词后面加上's`，且`后接单数名词`

   Tom's and Mike's rooms(两人各有一间，共两间，不是共同拥有)

   Tom and Mike's room(两人共同拥有的一间房间)

5. 表示时间、距离、价值等无生命的名词，也可加`'s'`构成所有格

   in five minutes’ time

   an hour’s walk

   five pounds’ worth of candy

6. 如果`'s`后的名词是商店、住宅等地点时，后面的名词常常省略

   at the butcher’s

   at my mother’s

### of短语

1. 表示无生命的所属关系时，要用介词“of”所构成的短语来表示

   the legs of the table

   the name of the hill

## 动名词

### 构成

1. 动词原形 + ing（具有动词特征的名词）

### 特点

1. 名词特征: 在句中可以充当主语, 宾语, 表语

   `Fishing` is my favorite sport. 主

   I like `fishing`. 动宾

   I am fond of ``fishing`. 介宾

2. 动词特征: 可以跟宾语, 甚至可以用副词修饰

   I don’t catch anything.
   ->  I often fish for hours `without catching anything`

   **一般来说, 动名词的逻辑主语应与主句主语统一。**

3. 若强调动名词的动作先发生, `则将 doing变为having done`

   He entered the room.
   He told me the news.
   -> `After entering the room`, he told me the news

   `After having entered the room`, he told me the news

   He apologized to me.
   He broke my favorite vase.
   ->  He apologized to me `for breaking my favorite vase`.

   ->  He apologized to me `for having broken my favorite vase`

4. `若动名词逻辑主语与主句主语不一致, 则必须保证没有任何歧义`

   He thanked me.
   I helped him.

   ->He thanked me `for helping him.`

## 不定式的时态和语态

不定式的时态看与谓语动词的关系; 不定式的语态看与逻辑主语的关系。

|            | 主动               | 被动              |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |

| 进行式     | to be doing        |                   |
| 完成式     | to have done       | to have been done |
| 完成进行式 | to have been doing |                   |

I helped him `to do` it.

I hope `to see` you soon

1. 一般式：强调与谓语动词同时发生或在谓语动词之后发生

   advised him `to save` the money.

   I advised the money `to be saved`.

2. 进行式：强调与谓语动词同时且正在发生

   It’s nice `to be lying` on the beach

   She answered `with a smile.`

   „Oh, is it?‟ said the sheriff `with a sneer.`

## 非谓语动词做定语

1. 分词作定语时, 若被修饰名词为动作的发出者用doing; 若被修饰名词为动作的承受者用done。

   单个分词多作前置定语, 分词短语多做后置定语。

   A `watched pot` never boils.

2. 不定式多作后置定语, 一般表示未做之事

   I have a lot of `work to do.`

   I need a `pen to write with.`

   We will buy a `house to live in.`

## it 作形式宾语的用法

1. 当`不定式`或`that引导的宾语从句`在句中`作宾语且其后跟有宾语补足语`(一般为形容词或名词)时，`通常会在原宾语的位置使用形式宾语it，而将真正的宾语移至句末。`

2. 基本结构

   `主语+ 谓语动词+ it + 宾语补足语`(adj./ n.)+`真正宾语`(to do/ that …)

   我认为`学英语`很有趣。

   I find `it` interesting `to study English`.

   我觉得`和他一起工作`很困难。

   I find `it` difficult `to work with him.`

   我认为`他没有通过考试`是个遗憾。

   I think `it` a pity `that he failed the test.`

::: warning 注意

若宾语补足语是 `no use / no good / no point / a waste of …`时, 真正宾语习惯上用动名词

I think `it` no use / no good / no point / a waste of time `arguing with him.`

:::
