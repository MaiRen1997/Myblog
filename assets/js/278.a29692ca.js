working with someone new,\nI ask them how I will know if they're struggling.\nAnd I don't mean struggling with a business problem\nor with a difficult analytics.\nThey don't struggle with that.\nI mean struggling with their mental health.\nAnd to make them feel comfortable to tell me,\nbecause I want them to tell me,\nI tell them how they will know if I'm struggling.\nSo I might be just unrealistically calm,\nor they might get any kind of message from me at all\nbefore nine in the morning.\nBecause I'm not a morning person,\nmessage before nine,\nvery bad sign.\nNow, I do this because I have suffered from anxiety and depression\nand it was horrible.\nAnd if there was a magic button I could press\nthat would rid the world of those two things,\nI'd press it straight away.\nBut if that button only worked for me,\nif all it meant is that I wouldn't have got depressed,\nI'd leave it alone.\nAnd that's because of some things that happened\nin the weeks and months as I was recovering from depression,\nbut also things that happened years later\nwhen I started talking about it at work,\nand it improved my relationships with colleagues.\nSo let's step back in time.\nIt's 2012,\nit's a Friday morning in May and the sun is out in London,\nand I'm walking to work along the banks of the Thames.\nAnd all around there are British flags flying.\nAnd there's this quiet excitement in the city.\nAnd that's because the Olympics were coming there in two month's time.\nAnd that morning, like every other morning at the time,\nI'd woken up about three hours earlier than normal\nthinking and worrying about work.\nAnd I'd got up just retching with anxiety\nand gone to the bathroom and been sick.\nAnd I felt a bit better after that, made my way to work.\nBut by the time I got to work, I could barely speak.\nSo I could just about order a cup of coffee.\nBut apart from that, for the mornings, I was pretty much silent.\nAnd coffee was about the extent of my diet,\nso I'd pretty much given up eating.\nAnd that's probably not what you would have expected\nif you'd been walking past me on that sunny Friday morning\nwith the flags flying and the Olympics coming.\nAnd after a couple of weeks things hadn't got any better\nand so I decided I shouldn't go to work.\nSo I phoned the team and told them,\nand a few days later, I got professional help.\nAnd what a difference that made.\nSo my psychologist gave me really simple, practical advice.\nThings like, you really need to eat\nbecause feeling anxious and feeling hungry\nare very similar feelings in your body.\nAnother bit of advice was,\ndon't get up and go to the bathroom and be sick.\nGet up, go to the kitchen, make a cup of tea, read a book.\nSo I did that, helped a bit with the morning vomiting.\nI had to learn how to switch off from work.\nNow anyone can stop working.\nThat's easy.\nThe difficult thing is stopping thinking about work.\nAnd to do that,\nI would imagine a green force field around the house\nthat would keep thoughts of work out.\nAnd I still switch that force field on\nfrom time to time.\nIt helps me put off until tomorrow things that I could do today.\nIf I do them tomorrow, they'll be a bit rushed.\nThey will be less good, but they'll be good enough.\nAnd my wife, who saw this change in my working patterns,\nwas convinced I was going to get fired.\nI actually have been promoted twice since then.\nNow I also had to learn how to enjoy spending time with my wife\nand with my family and friends.\nAnd it sounds easy, but it really wasn't at first.\nSo I remember going out for a pizza with the family,\nand all I wanted to do was lie on the floor,\ncurl up into a ball and groan.\nNow, fortunately for everyone in the pizza restaurant,\nI didn't do that.\nBut it was still really awkward\nbecause all I could think of to talk about was how miserable I was.\nAnyway, with a bit of practice, it got less awkward.\nI got a bit less self-absorbed and I learned to enjoy other people again.\nAnd one day, about a few weeks after I first got professional help,\nI woke up in the morning feeling fine,\njust feeling normal.\nAnd I have done every day since then.\nNow, some people can do a really good job at work\nwhen they're anxious or depressed.\nAnd I am not one of those people.\nSo I really did a terrible job.\nThe team had to carry me.\nIt's really very difficult to contribute if you can't speak all morning.\nIt was the first time I'd ever really failed at anything.\nAnd I can't tell you how comforting it is now\nto know that I can fail at something,\neven something quite important,\nlife will go on and I'll be fine.\nAnd because I'd done such a terrible job at work,\nI didn't want anyone to know about it.\nIt was this kind of shameful secret.\nSo the strange thing is\nwhat happened when I did start talking about it at work,\nand it started very privately.\nSo if I was working with someone\nand it seemed like they were struggling,\nI'd tell them some of my story.\nThat seemed to help a bit.\nIt wasn't as awkward and horrible as I thought it might be.\nSo I got a bit braver and I said to our HR team,\n\"If you come across someone who's struggling with their mental health,\nI'll be happy to talk to them one-on-one if you think it would help.\"\nI did that a few times and I still do.\nAnd what that meant was\nwhen the HR team were putting together a booklet\nabout what to do if you're struggling with your mental health,\nthey asked me and some other people to share our stories anonymously.\nAnd I did that.\nBut when I sent the message,\nI asked them to print my name next to it.\nNow, have you ever sent a message and thought,\n\"I wonder if that was a good idea?\"\nSo that was what I felt.\nAnd I was quite scared, it was going to hundreds of people,\nthere was no going back. It was in writing.\nAnd I was worried people would think it would happen again\nand they wouldn't want to work with me.\nI was worried they'd think I was weak and self-indulgent,\nand maybe some people do.\nAnd I was worried\nthat even if they didn't think either of those things,\nit would just be on their minds when they were talking to me later on.\nThat's not what happened.\nWhat actually happened was people got in touch\nto say there was really comforting to have someone quite senior say,\n\"I had this experience.\nIt was horrible.\nI got through it,\nI'm still here and I'm doing fine.\"\nAnd gradually I started talking about it to larger and larger audiences.\nSo there's a podcast about it.\nWe did a session for people who were struggling during lockdown,\nand if you're not sick of hearing about me being sick in the mornings,\nyou can read about it on two websites.\nAnd one day, about ten years after that sunny day in London,\nI stood up in front of 600 of my colleagues\nand told them the full story.\nAnd after that,\npeople from all levels of the company, right up to the very top,\ntook me aside and shared\nthat they had either been through something like that,\nor they were going through something like that at the time.\nAnd then I'd say the most common emotion\nthat I picked up from them was relief,\nthat they were just relieved that someone was talking about it openly.\nOne person actually took me aside on the stairs more than a year later,\nto say that it had given him that push he needed and wanted\nto go and get some help for some things\nhe was struggling with at the time.\nNow, one of the people in that audience of 600\nwas new to the company.\nAnd she said to me,\n\"Hearing that talk made me feel like this was my kind of place.\"\nAnd I think she actually got to the bottom of what it made me feel like.\nSo if I could stand up in front of all my colleagues\nand tell them this story that had been terribly embarrassing\nand upsetting and shameful,\nfelt shameful at the time,\nand I was fine,\nwell, it made it feel like my kind of place too.\nAnd we know from Amy Edmondson's work on psychological safety\nthat that feeling improves the performance of teams.\nNow, I didn't stand up and tell 600 people about vomiting in the morning\nto improve their performance,\nbut if it does, I'll take it, that's great.\nIt is possible to go too far with this,\nand I know that because I did.\nSo I got some great anonymous feedback that said,\n\"Adam is always talking to me\nto make sure I'm not depressed or anxious.\nHe never talks to me about work or my career.\"\nSo after that I changed a bit what I talk to people about.\nNow, I'm not saying that if you've suffered from mental illness,\nyou should tell everyone at work all about it.\nIf you're experiencing it now,\nyou probably won't regret telling someone you trust.\nIf you've recovered, you may find, like me,\nthat telling people about it goes better than you expect.\nThere's no guarantees and there's still plenty of prejudice around.\nNor am I saying that if you are suffering from anxiety or depression,\nyou should be really thankful\nbecause of all these terrific benefits you're going to get that I got,\nand it's good for your character.\nI'm not saying that at all.\nIt's really horrible\nand I feel for you.\nIf you are lucky enough to be able to get professional help,\nplease do.\nI cannot tell you how much of a difference that has made to my life.\nIf you can't get professional help, look for free resources online.\nAnd in either case, remember\nthat you're not the first person to have gone through something like this,\nthat depression and anxiety are treatable.\nAnd that you are not alone.\nNow on that sunny Friday morning in London,\nI had no idea that within a few months\nI would have recovered to something better than I was\nbefore I started to get anxious.\nAnd when I felt really worried,\nsending the message to the HR team about printing my name next to my story,\nI had no idea what would follow from that\nand how beneficial it would be for me and for other people.\nThere's no guarantees that anyone else will experience the same thing.\nAnd that's why if there was this magic button\nfor ridding the world of anxiety and depression,\nI'd press it straight away.\nBut unfortunately that button is still an imaginary button.\nIt's not real.\nAnd while it stays like that,\nI think we would all do better by talking about it.\nThank you.\n(Applause)")]),this._v("

2012 年，\n"五月的一个星期五早晨，\n伦敦阳光明媚，"\n"我\n沿着泰晤士河畔步行去上班。"\n"周围\n飘扬着英国国旗。 这座"\n"\n城市里充满了安静的兴奋。"\n"那是因为\n两个月后奥运会就要在那里举行。"\n"那天早上，就像\n当时的每个早晨一样，"\n"我\n比正常"\n思考和担心工作的时间早了大约三个小时。\n我起床后就因为焦虑而干呕，\n然后去了洗手间，然后就恶心了。\n"之后我感觉好多了，\n就去上班了。"\n"但当我开始工作时，\n我几乎无法说话。"\n"所以我可以点\n一杯咖啡。"\n"但除此之外，早上\n我几乎保持沉默。"\n"咖啡与\n我的饮食结构有关，"\n所以我几乎放弃了进食。\n"如果你在\n那个阳光明媚的星期五早晨从我身边走过，"\n"旗帜飘扬\n，奥运会即将来临，你可能不会想到这一点。"\n"几周后，\n情况没有任何好转"\n，所以我决定不去上班。\n所以我打电话给团队并告诉他们，\n"几天后，\n我得到了专业帮助。 这"\n带来了多么大的变化啊。\n"所以我的心理学家给了我\n非常简单、实用的建议。"\n比如，你确实需要吃东西，\n因为感到焦虑和饥饿\n是你体内的感觉非常相似。\n另一条建议是，\n"不要起床\n去洗手间就生病了。"\n"起床，去厨房，\n泡杯茶，看看书。"\n"所以我就这么做了，\n对早上的呕吐有所帮助。"\n"我必须学习\n如何从工作中解脱出来。"\n现在任何人都可以停止工作。\n这很容易。\n"困难的是停止\n思考工作。"\n为了做到这一点，\n"我会想象\n房子周围有一个绿色的力场，"\n可以让人们不去想锻炼的事情。\n我仍然时不时地打开那个力场\n。\n"它帮助我把\n今天能做的事情推迟到明天。"\n"如果我明天做的话，\n他们会有点匆忙。"\n"他们会不太好，\n但他们会足够好。"\n"我的妻子看到\n我工作模式的这种变化，"\n确信我会被解雇。 从那以后\n"我实际上已经升职了\n两次。"\n"现在我还必须学习如何享受\n与妻子"\n、家人和朋友共度时光。\n"这听起来很容易，\n但一开始确实不容易。"\n"所以我记得\n和家人一起出去吃披萨，"\n"我想做的就是\n躺在地板上，"\n蜷缩成一团，呻吟。\n"现在，对于披萨餐厅的每个人来说幸运的是\n，"\n我没有这样做。\n但这仍然很尴尬，\n"因为我所能想到的就是谈论\n我是多么痛苦。"\n"不管怎样，经过一些练习，\n就不再那么尴尬了。"\n"我不再那么自私了，\n我又学会了享受别人。 有"\n"一天，大约在\n我第一次获得专业帮助几周后，"\n我早上醒来感觉很好，\n感觉很正常。\n从那时起我每天都这样做。\n"现在，有些人\n"\n在焦虑或抑郁时仍能很好地工作。\n而我不是那些人中的一员。\n所以我确实做得很糟糕。\n球队必须扛着我。\n"\n如果你整个上午都不能说话，真的很难做出贡献。"\n"这是我第一次\n在任何事情上真正失败。"\n"我无法告诉你\n现在"\n知道我可能会在某些事情上失败，\n即使是一些非常重要的事情，\n生活还会继续，我会没事的，这是多么令人欣慰。\n"因为我\n在工作中做得很糟糕，所以"\n我不想让任何人知道这件事。 这\n是一个令人羞耻的秘密。\n所以奇怪的事情是\n"当我\n在工作中开始谈论这件事时发生的事情，"\n而且是在非常私密的情况下开始的。\n因此，如果我和某人一起工作，\n而他们似乎正在挣扎，\n我会告诉他们一些我的故事。\n这似乎有点帮助。\n"这并不\n像我想象的那么尴尬和可怕。"\n"所以我变得更勇敢了，\n我对我们的人力资源团队说："\n"“如果你遇到一个正在\n与心理健康作斗争的人，如果你认为这会有所帮助，"\n"我很乐意与他们进行一对一的交谈\n。”"\n我这样做过几次，现在仍然如此。\n这意味着\n"当人力资源团队\n整理一本"\n"关于如果你在\n心理健康方面遇到困难时该怎么办的小册子时，"\n"他们要求我和其他一些人\n匿名分享我们的故事。"\n我就这么做了。\n但当我发送消息时，\n我要求他们在旁边写上我的名字。\n"现在，您是否曾在发送\n消息时想："\n“我想知道这是否是一个好主意？”\n这就是我的感受。\n"我很害怕，\n这会影响数百人，"\n"没有回头路。\n这是书面形式。"\n"我担心人们会认为\n这种情况会再次发生，"\n他们就不想和我一起工作。\n"我担心他们会认为\n我软弱和自我放纵，"\n也许有些人确实这么认为。\n我担心\n"即使他们没有想到\n这些事情，当"\n"\n他们稍后与我交谈时也会想到这些事情。 事实"\n并非如此。\n"实际发生的事情\n是，人们联系上"\n"说，\n有一位资深人士说，"\n“我有过这样的经历。太\n可怕了。\n我熬过来了，我\n还在这里，我做得很好。”\n"渐渐地，我开始\n向越来越多的观众谈论它。"\n所以有一个关于它的播客。\n"我们为那些\n在封锁期间苦苦挣扎的人们举办了一次会议，"\n"如果你不厌倦听到\n我早上生病的消息，"\n你可以在两个网站上阅读相关内容。 有\n"一天，距离\n伦敦那个阳光灿烂的日子大约十年后，"\n"我站在\n600 名同事面前，向"\n他们讲述了整个故事。\n之后，\n"公司各个级别的人，\n直到最高层，"\n都把我拉到一边，告诉我\n"他们要么\n经历过类似的事情，"\n"要么当时正在经历\n类似的事情。"\n然后我会说，\n我从他们那里得到的最常见的情绪是解脱，\n"他们只是因为有人\n公开谈论这件事而松了一口气。 一年多后，"\n"一个人实际上\n在楼梯上把我拉到一边，"\n"说这给了他\n所需的推动力，并"\n想为他当时遇到的一些问题寻求帮助\n。\n"现在，\n这 600 名观众中有一位"\n是公司的新人。\n她对我说：\n"“听到那个谈话让我\n觉得这就是我喜欢的地方。”"\n"我认为她实际上已经了解了\n我的感受。"\n"因此，如果我能站在\n所有同事面前，"\n"告诉他们这个非常\n尴尬"\n、令人不安和可耻的故事，\n当时我感到很羞耻，\n而我很好，\n"嗯，这让我感觉这里也\n像我一样。  。"\n"我们从艾米·埃德蒙森关于心理安全的研究中知道，\n"\n"这种感觉可以提高\n团队的表现。"\n"现在，我没有站出来告诉 600 个人\n早上呕吐的事情，"\n以提高他们的表现，\n"但如果确实如此，\n我会接受，那太好了。"\n这样做可能会走得太远，\n我知道这一点，因为我就是这么做的。\n"所以我得到了一些很好的匿名\n反馈，他们说："\n“亚当总是和我说话，\n以确保我不会沮丧或焦虑。\n"他从不和我谈论\n工作或我的职业生涯。”"\n"所以在那之后我改变了\n我和人们谈论的内容。"\n"现在，我并不是说如果你\n患有精神疾病，"\n"你应该告诉\n工作中的每个人。"\n如果您现在正在经历这种情况，\n"您可能不会后悔\n告诉您信任的人。"\n"如果您已经康复，\n您可能会像我一样发现，"\n"告诉人们这件事\n比您预期的要好。"\n"没有任何保证，而且仍然存在\n很多偏见。"\n"我也不是说，如果你患有\n焦虑或抑郁，"\n你应该非常感激，\n"因为\n你将得到我所得到的所有这些了不起的好处，这"\n对你的性格有好处。\n我根本不是这么说的。\n这真的太可怕了，\n我为你感到难过。\n"如果您足够幸运\n能够获得专业帮助，"\n请这样做。\n"我无法告诉你\n这对我的生活产生了多大的影响。"\n"如果您无法获得专业帮助，请\n在线寻找免费资源。"\n无论哪种情况，请记住，\n"您不是第一个\n经历过此类事情的人，"\n抑郁和焦虑是可以治疗的。\n而且你并不孤单。\n"现在，在伦敦那个阳光明媚的周五\n早晨，"\n我不知道几个月内\n"我会恢复\n到比"\n开始焦虑之前更好的状态。\n当我感到非常担心时，\n"向人力资源团队发送\n关于在我的故事旁边印上我的名字的信息，"\n我不知道会发生什么，\n"也不知道这\n对我和其他人有多大好处。"\n"无法保证其他人\n会经历同样的事情。"\n"这就是为什么如果有\n这个神奇的按钮"\n"可以消除世界上\n的焦虑和抑郁，"\n我会立即按下它。\n"但不幸的是，这个按钮\n仍然是一个想象中的按钮。"\n这不是真的。\n虽然情况仍然如此，但\n"我认为\n通过谈论它，我们都会做得更好。"\n谢谢。\n（掌声）')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=a.exports}}]);
