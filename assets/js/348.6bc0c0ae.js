岁了。”"\n"即使我这样做了，雇主难道不会更愿意\n雇用年龄只有我一半的人吗？”"\n我的意思是，我得到了他的关心，\n"而且我还有很多其他朋友和客户也\n一直在问我类似的问题。"\n"说实话，\n有时候我也担心这个问题。"\n"你看，我是一名顾问，\n像我这样的顾问"\n"\n因创建这些广泛的、"\n"深入研究的、\n精心打磨的幻灯片而闻名，或者你们中的一些人甚至可能会说臭名昭著。"\n但你知道吗？\n我们对这种能力感到非常自豪。\n"但由于人工智能，过去需要几天\n甚至几周的时间"\n"现在可以\n在几个小时内完成。"\n"嗯，这种事情在\n整个经济领域都在发生。"\n全球每三个工人中就有一个\n"会发现他们的工作\n"\n在这十年中因技术而受到重大影响。\n"这不仅包括银行出纳员、\n工厂工人和仓库工作人员，"\n"还包括执行经理\n和办公室职员。"\n你和我以及我们所有人。\n"这将有\n超过十亿人受到影响。"\n"公司无法\n通过招聘来解决这个问题。"\n"首先，\n数据科学、"\n网络安全或清洁能源等不断发展的领域缺乏足够的人才。\n即使公司设法以\n"某种方式聘请到\n绝对最优秀的人才，"\n五年后，\n"他们的一半技能\n将变得多余。"\n"\n如果您从事技术工作，则需要两年半。"\n"这就是我们所说的\n技能的半衰期。"\n"唯一的解决方案是每年对数百万人进行重新培训，\n"\n"让他们利用这些新技能\n过渡到新的职业。"\n但正如我所说，我确实意识到\n"这将是一个极其\n复杂的社会挑战，"\n"而且如此巨大，政府、公司\n和个人必须共同努力。"\n他们必须共同努力。\n"我相信，前进的唯一出路\n就是用好奇和乐观取代我们的恐惧"\n和怀疑\n。\n我知道这是可能的，\n"因为我\n与新加坡政府合作开展"\n"其最大的\n数字再培训计划之一的经验。"\n新加坡是一个很小的国家，\n在世界地图上几乎看不见，\n并且缺乏任何主要的自然资源。\n"但他们很早就意识到，\n国家发展的唯一途径"\n是人民的发展。\n"从那时起，他们就\n如此兴奋地接受了重新技能培训，"\n以至于如果您访问新加坡，\n"您很可能会\n在购物中心遇到技能大使，他们兴奋"\n"地谈论\n"\n通过游戏化互动亭培养成人技能的影响。\n"他们\n在国家新闻中分享有关再培训的积极故事，"\n甚至将再培训\n视为国防议程的一部分，\n"以应对经济面临的威胁和挑战\n。 今年新加坡国庆阅兵上"\n甚至还有“终身学习”花车\n"\n。"\n"看到一个国家采取如此积极\n主动的做法，不是很不寻常吗？"\n但对我来说，毫不奇怪的是，\n在2020年失业率创纪录的时期，\n"政府联系\n我的公司，询问"\n"我们是否可以收一些失业\n工人作为实习生。"\n"但那次谈话很快就演变\n成了更大的事情。"\n"很快，我们共同\n启动了一项"\n名为“Rise”的大规模、为期六个月的计划，\n"旨在将数千名个人\n从传统的日渐衰退的角色转变"\n为数据科学家、\n"数字产品所有者\n和数字营销人员等角色。"\n但是……\n随着我们项目申请的增加，\n我的紧张感也随之增加。\n"我们的许多申请者已经\n脱离正规教育"\n超过 20 年了。\n"西蒙 (Simon) 53 岁，\n来自建筑行业，"\n经历了两次经济危机，他\n"意识到自己现在想\n进入数字化职业。"\n哈菲扎花了\n"七个多月的时间\n寻找完美的工作，她"\n意识到她需要新的技能\n"来摆脱\n她所工作的传统媒体行业，因为"\n该行业正在受到技术的影响。\n当我与许多学习者交谈时，\n"我很清楚这\n对他们来说并不是一个容易的过渡。"\n因此，从第一周开始，\n"我们不仅专注\n于培养他们的技能，"\n还培养他们的心态，\n"并建立\n他们对重新学习技能"\n和实现职业转型的能力的信心。 正是在这个时候，\n我们教给他们\n诸如解决问题的第一原则等技能，这是\n"我们顾问用来解决\n客户的一些难题的策略。"\n"第一原则问题解决\n是挑战假设，"\n以确定要解决的真正问题，\n"然后\n从多个新的角度看待问题，"\n"即使您一开始可能没有深厚的\n主题专业知识，"\n"然后\n以简洁的方式提炼出核心见解 。"\n"这些解决问题的首要原则\n将使我们的学习者做好准备，"\n"在这些新的工作领域中发现自己不熟悉的情况下茁壮成长\n"\n。\n"然后，为了教他们数字\n或技术技能，"\n"我们必须\n为成熟的学习者提供非常非常真实和实用的东西。"\n"因此，我们将他们的技能\n运用到实际项目中。"\n"我们邀请了\n奥兰、"\n"达能和新加坡航空等公司的高管\n来举办黑客马拉松。"\n"我仍然记得\n一场黑客马拉松展示，"\n我们的“Rise”学习者\n展示了他们所做的深入用户研究，\n"以及他们推荐的数字应用程序的模型\n。"\n"一位客户专业人士\n非常兴奋，他告诉他们，"\n"“这就像专业的\n咨询工作。”"\n我坐在那儿面带微笑，\n"因为我知道，如果这些学员\n去求职，"\n"他们的申请\n在第一阶段就会被筛选掉。"\n"然而，超过 80%\n的学习者找到了工作。"\n我们的朋友西蒙，\n"他被聘为\nIn-Shore Tech 的数字项目经理。"\nHafiza 是\n一家网络安全公司的数字营销专家。\n"每当\n我们项目中的某人找到工作时，"\n我们都感到像自豪的父母一样。\n我告诉你，这样的幸福。\n"但新加坡政府在\n"\n“崛起”等项目的成功中发挥着重要作用。\n他们创建了一个全国性的就业数据库，\n"并激励公司\n雇用此类重新技能化的人才。"\n"他们甚至引导学术界\n从高等教育过渡"\n到持续学习。\n"他们成功地将人们的\n看法从恐惧转变为好奇，"\n仅 2021 年就有\n超过 660,000 名个人\n和超过 24,000 家公司\n参与了他们的项目。\n"如果您认为新加坡是独一无二的，那么\n我们并不是唯一的。"\n"意大利、西班牙、印度\n和许多其他国家"\n"正在启动类似的\n技能计划。"\n但除了政府的作用之外，\n公司在将\n这种心态从怀疑态度转变为\n对再培训的乐观态度方面发挥着重要作用。 以\n全球家具制造商宜家为例。\n2021 年，\n宜家推出了这款名为 Billy 的人工智能机器人，\n"用于管理大部分\n日常客户咨询。"\n但等一下。\n"所有这些\n呼叫中心员工会发生什么？"\n他们会失去工作吗？\n不。\n"这就是宜家选择\n采取革命性方法的地方，"\n"他们实际上最终将\n8,500 多名"\n呼叫中心员工重新培训\n"为室内设计顾问，\n为客户提供新的"\n"个性化设计服务\n。"\n这个故事最精彩的部分\n是，宜家赢得了\n员工和顾客的心，\n而且仅 2022 年就实现了\n"超过 14 亿\n美元的增量销售额。"\n"现在最终超越了\n政府和公司，"\n真正的改变必须来自我们所有人。\n"我一直在努力\n投资自己的技能，"\n"而不是太担心\n我漂亮的幻灯片和人工智能，"\n"并\n为我六岁的孩子建立终身学习行为模型。"\n"他有一个存钱罐，\n我们称之为“我的学习银行”，"\n可以省钱学习新技能。\n"最近，我们用积蓄开设了\n儿童机器人课程。"\n我告诉你，他只是喜欢建造东西。\n"他非常非常兴奋地展示了\n他制作的"\n可以一步一步行走的长颈鹿。\n"我们需要一步一步地\n拥抱再培训革命。"\n"技术带来的工作演变\n将成为"\n我们必须生活的世界的新现实。\n"但我们必须怀着好奇和乐观的态度来接受这一点，而不是\n带着恐惧和怀疑，"\n而是一次\n又一次地培养我们的技能。\n谢谢。\n（掌声）')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);e.default=i.exports}}]);
