farmers.\t关于人工智能和农民的故事。\nNow, what a strange combination, right?\t现在，这是多么奇怪的组合，对吧？\nTwo topics could not sound more different from each other.\t"两个主题听起来\n截然不同。"\nBut did you know that modern farming actually involves a lot of technology?\t"但你知道现代农业\n实际上涉及很多技术吗？"\nSo computer vision is used to predict crop yields.\t"因此计算机视觉被用来\n预测农作物产量。"\nAnd artificial intelligence is used to find,\t"人工智能\n用于发现、"\nidentify and get rid of insects.\t识别和消灭昆虫。\nPredictive analytics helps figure out extreme weather conditions\t"预测分析有助于找出\n"\nlike drought or hurricanes.\t干旱或飓风等极端天气条件。\nBut this technology is also alienating to farmers.\t"但这项技术\n也让农民感到陌生。"\nAnd this all came to a head in 2017\t2017 年，\nwith the tractor company John Deere when they introduced smart tractors.\t"拖拉机公司约翰迪尔 (John Deere)\n推出了智能拖拉机，这一切都达到了顶峰。"\nSo before then, if a farmer\'s tractor broke,\t"所以在此之前，\n如果农民的拖拉机坏了，"\nthey could just repair it themselves or take it to a mechanic.\t"他们只能自己修理\n或交给机械师。"\nWell, the company actually made it illegal\t嗯，该公司实际上将\nfor farmers to fix their own equipment.\t农民自己修理设备定为非法。\nYou had to use a licensed technician\t你必须使用有执照的技术人员，\nand farmers would have to wait for weeks\t农民们必须等待数周，\nwhile their crops rot and pests took over.\t直到他们的农作物腐烂和害虫蔓延。\nSo they took matters into their own hands.\t所以他们把事情掌握在自己手中。\nSome of them learned to program,\t他们中的一些人学会了编程，\nand they worked with hackers to create patches to repair their own systems.\t"并与黑客合作创建\n补丁来修复自己的系统。"\nIn 2022,\t2022 年，在世界上\nat one of the largest hacker conferences in the world, DEFCON,\t"最大的黑客\n会议之一 DEFCON 上，"\na hacker named Sick Codes and his team\t一位名叫 Sick Codes 的黑客和他的团队向\nshowed everybody how to break into a John Deere tractor,\t"所有人展示了如何闯\n入约翰迪尔拖拉机，这"\nshowing that, first of all, the technology was vulnerable,\t"表明，首先，\n该技术是脆弱的，"\nbut also that you can and should own your own equipment.\t"但也表明 您可以而且应该\n拥有自己的设备。"\nTo be clear, this is illegal,\t需要明确的是，这是非法的，\nbut there are people trying to change that.\t"但有人\n试图改变这一点。"\nNow that movement is called the “right to repair.”\t"现在，这项运动被称为\n“修复权”。"\nThe right to repair goes something like this.\t"修理权\n是这样的。"\nIf you own a piece of technology,\t如果你拥有一项技术，\nit could be a tractor, a smart toothbrush,\t它可能是拖拉机、智能牙刷、\na washing machine,\t洗衣机，\nyou should have the right to repair it if it breaks.\t"\n如果它坏了，你应该有权修理它。"\nSo why am I telling you this story?\t那么我为什么要告诉你这个故事呢？\nThe right to repair needs to extend to artificial intelligence.\t"修复权需要延伸\n至人工智能。"\nNow it seems like every week\t现在，人工智能领域似乎每周都会出现\nthere is a new and mind-blowing innovation in AI.\t"令人兴奋的新\n创新。"\nBut did you know that public confidence is actually declining?\t"但你知道公众信心\n实际上正在下降吗？"\nA recent Pew poll showed that more Americans are concerned\t"皮尤研究中心最近的一项民意调查显示，对这项技术感到\n担忧的美国人"\nthan they are excited about the technology.\t"多于兴奋的美国人\n。"\nThis is echoed throughout the world.\t这在世界各地得到回应。\nThe World Risk Poll

this technology can lead to good.\t"因为我坚信\n这项技术可以带来好处。"\nSo what\'s the disconnect?\t那么脱节是什么？\nWell, I\'ve talked to hundreds of people over the last few years.\t"嗯，过去几年我已经和数百人交谈过\n。"\nArchitects and scientists, journalists and photographers,\t"建筑师和科学家、\n记者和摄影师、"\nride-share drivers and doctors,\t拼车司机和医生，\nand they all say the same thing.\t他们都说同样的话。\nPeople feel like an afterthought.\t人们感觉像是事后诸葛亮。\nThey all know that their data is harvested often without their permission\t"他们都知道，他们的数据\n经常在未经他们许可的情况下被收集来"\nto create these sophisticated systems.\t创建这些复杂的系统。\nThey know

these AI systems should interact in their world.\t"这些人工智能系统\n应该如何在他们的世界中互动的人之间建立更好的反馈循环。"\nOne step towards this is a process called red teaming.\t"实现这一目标的一个步骤\n是称为红队的过程。"\nNow, red teaming is a practice that was started in the military,\t"现在，红队是一种\n从军队开始的做法，"\nand it\'s used in cybersecurity.\t并用于网络安全。\nIn a traditional red-teaming exercise,\t在传统的红队演习中，\nexternal experts are brought in to break into a system,\t"外部专家被请来\n闯入系统，"\nsort of like what Sick Codes did with tractors, but legal.\t"有点像 Sick Codes\n对拖拉机所做的那样，但合法。"\nSo red teaming acts as a way of testing your defenses\t"因此，红队是\n测试你的防御能力的一种方式"\nand when you can figure out where something will go wrong,\t"，当你能找出\n哪里出了问题时，"\nyou can figure out how to fix it.\t你就能找出解决方法。\nBut when AI systems go rogue,\t但当人工智能系统失控时，\nit\'s more than just a hacker breaking in.\t这不仅仅是黑客闯入的问题。\nThe model could malfunction or misrepresent reality.\t"该模型可能会发生故障\n或歪曲现实。"\nSo, for example, not too long ago,\t例如，不久前，\nwe saw an AI system attempting diversity\t我们看到一个人工智能系统\nby showing historically inaccurate photos.\t通过显示历史上不准确的照片来尝试多样性。\nAnybody with a basic understanding of Western

an expert?\t，谁有资格成为专家呢？\nYou.\t你。\nI\'m working with thousands of people all around the world\t"我正在与世界各地的数千人合作进行\n"\non large and small red-teaming exercises,\t大大小小的红队练习，\nand through them we found and fixed mistakes in AI models.\t"通过他们我们发现\n并修复了人工智能模型中的错误。"\nWe also work with some of the biggest tech companies in the world:\t"我们还与世界上一些最大的\n科技公司合作："\nOpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, Google.\tOpenAI、Meta、Anthropic、Google。\nAnd through this, we\'ve made models work better for more people.\t"通过这一点，我们让模型\n更好地为更多人服务。"\nHere\'s a bit of what we\'ve learned.\t这是我们学到的一些内容。\nWe partnered with the Royal Society in London to do a scientific,\t"我们与伦敦皇家学会合作，与疾病科学家一起\n举办了一场科学、"\nmis- and disinformation event with disease scientists.\t"错误和虚假信息活动\n。"\nWhat these scientists found\t这些科学家发现，\nis that AI models actually had a lot of protections\t"人工智能模型实际上\n"\nagainst COVID misinformation.\t对新冠错误信息有很多保护措施。\nBut for other diseases like measles, mumps and the flu,\t"但对于麻疹、\n腮腺炎和流感等其他疾病，"\nthe same protections didn\'t apply.\t同样的保护措施并不适用。\nWe reported these changes,\t我们报告了这些变化，\nthey’re fixed and now we are all better protected\t"它们已得到修复，现在\n我们都得到了更好的保护，"\nagainst scientific mis- and disinformation.\t"免受科学错误\n和虚假信息的侵害。"\nWe did a really similar exercise with architects at Autodesk University,\t"我们与欧特克大学的建筑师进行了非常类似的练习\n，"\nand we asked them a simple question:\t我们问他们一个简单的问题：\nWill AI put them out of a job?\t人工智能会让他们失业吗？\nOr more specifically,\t或者更具体地说，\ncould they imagine a modern AI system\t他们能否想象一个\nthat would be able to design the specs of a modern art museum?\t"能够设计\n现代艺术博物馆规格的现代人工智能系统？"\nThe answer, resoundingly, was no.\t答案是否定的。\nHere\'s why, architects do more than just draw buildings.\t"这就是为什么建筑师所做的\n不仅仅是绘制建筑物。"\nThey have to understand physics and material science.\t"他们必须了解物理学\n和材料科学。"\nThey have to know building codes,\t他们必须了解建筑规范，\nand they have to do that\t并且必须在\nwhile making something that evokes emotion.\t"制作能够\n唤起情感的东西的同时做到这一点。"\nWhat the architects wanted was an AI system\t"建筑师想要的\n是一个能够"\nthat interacted with them, that would give them feedback,\t"与他们交互的人工智能系统，\n可以给他们反馈，"\nmaybe proactively offer design recommendations.\t"也许可以主动提供\n设计建议。"\nAnd today\'s AI systems, not quite there yet.\t"而今天的人工智能系统\n还没有完全实现。"\nBut those are technical problems.\t但这些都是技术问题。\nPeople building AI are incredibly smart,\t构建人工智能的人非常聪明，\nand maybe they could solve all that in a few years.\t"也许他们可以\n在几年内解决所有问题。"\nBut that wasn\'t their biggest concern.\t但这并不是他们最关心的问题。\nTheir biggest concern was trust.\t他们最关心的是信任。\nNow architects are liable if something goes wrong with their buildings.\t"现在，如果\n他们的建筑出现问题，建筑师就要承担责任。"\nThey could lose their license,\t他们可能会被吊销驾照，\nthey could be fined, they could even go to prison.\t"可能会被罚款，甚至\n可能会入狱。"\nAnd failures can happen in a million different ways.\t"失败可能\n以一百万种不同的方式发生。"\nFor example, exit doors that open the wrong way,\t"例如，出口门\n打开方向错误，"\nleading to people being crushed in an evacuation crisis,\t"导致人们\n在疏散危机中被压伤，"\nor broken glass raining down onto pedestrians in the street\t"或者\n"\nbecause the wind blows too hard and shatters windows.\t"由于风吹得太猛，\n窗户被吹碎，碎玻璃如雨点般落到街上的行人身上。"\nSo why would an architect trust an AI system with their job,\t"那么，如果建筑师在发现错误时无法介入并修复错误，为什么他们会信任\n人工智能系统来完成他们的工作和"\nwith their literal freedom,\t真正的自由呢\nif they couldn\'t go in and fix a mistake if they found it?\t"\n？"\nSo we need to figure out these problems today, and I\'ll tell you why.\t"所以我们今天需要弄清楚这些问题\n，我会告诉你原因。"\nThe next wave of artificial intelligence systems, called agentic AI,\t"下一波人工智能\n系统被称为代理人工智能，它"\nis a true tipping point\t是\nbetween whether or not we retain human agency,\t"\n我们是否保留人类代理"\nor whether or not AI systems make our decisions for us.\t"或人工智能系统是否\n为我们做出决定之间的真正转折点。"\nImagine an AI agent as kind of like a personal assistant.\t"想象一下人工智能代理有点\n像私人助理。"\nSo, for example, a medical agent might determine\t"例如，\n医疗代理人可能会确定"\nwhether or not your family needs doctor\'s appointments,\t"您的家人是否需要\n预约医生，"\nit might refill prescription medications, or in case of an emergency,\t"可能会补充处方药，\n或者在紧急情况下将"\nsend medical records to the hospital.\t医疗记录发送到医院。\nBut AI agents can\'t and won\'t exist\t但\nunless we have a true right to repair.\t除非我们拥有真正的修复权，否则人工智能代理不能也不可能存在。 除非你能进行一些基本的诊断，否则\nWhat parent would trust their child\'s health to an AI system\t"哪个父母会把\n孩子的健康托付给人工智能系统呢"\nunless you could run some basic diagnostics?\t"\n？ 除非你能像初级员工那样重新培训它，否则"\nWhat professional would trust an AI system with job decisions,\t"哪个专业人士会信任\n人工智能系统来做出工作决策呢"\nunless you could retrain it the way you might a junior employee?\t"\n？"\nNow, a right to repair might look something like this.\t"现在，修复权\n可能看起来像这样。"\nYou could have a diagnostics board\t您可以有一个诊断板，\nwhere you run basic tests that you design,\t您可以在其中运行您设计的基本测试，\nand if something\'s wrong, you could report it to the company\t"如果出现问题，\n您可以向公司报告"\nand hear back when it\'s fixed.\t并在修复后收到回复。\nOr you could work with third parties like ethical hackers\t"或者您可以与第三方合作，\n例如道德黑客，"\nwho make patches for systems like we do today.\t"他们像我们今天一样为系统制作补丁\n。"\nYou can download them and use them to improve your system\t"您可以下载它们并使用它们\n"\nthe way you want it to be improved.\t按照您希望的方式改进您的系统。\nOr you could be like these intrepid farmers and learn to program\t"或者您可以像这些勇敢的\n农民一样，学习编程"\nand fine-tune your own systems.\t和微调自己的系统。\nWe won\'t achieve the promised benefits of artificial intelligence\t-\nunless we figure out how to bring people into the development process.\t"除非我们弄清楚如何让人们\n参与开发过程，否则我们无法实现人工智能所承诺的好处。"\nI\'ve dedicated my career to responsible AI,\t"我将我的职业生涯奉献\n给了负责任的人工智能，"\nand in that field we ask the question,\t在这个领域我们提出这样的问题：\nwhat can companies build to ensure that people trust AI?\t"公司可以构建什么\n来确保人们信任人工智能？"\nNow, through these red-teaming exercises, and by talking to you,\t"现在，通过这些红队练习\n以及与您的交谈，"\nI\'ve come to realize that we\'ve been asking the wrong question all along.\t"我逐渐意识到我们一直在\n问错误的问题。"\nWhat we should have been asking is what tools can we build\t"我们应该问的\n是，我们可以构建哪些工具，"\nso people can make AI beneficial for them?\t以便人们可以让人工智能为他们带来好处？\nTechnologists can\'t do it alone.\t技术人员无法单独做到这一点。\nWe can only do it
