这里的大多数人\n纯粹是出于爱情而约会，我们 并不会过多考虑\n伴侣的财务状况、工作 或拥有多少财产，而且\n美国没有 Ty，通常在 你结婚后你会 一起去买房子，\n然后把你们的收入结合 在一起还清，所以当我们约会的时候，我们\n基本上只是认为 找到一个有着相似价值观和\n相似人生目标的人很重要，但最重要的是我们想要 一个我们可以爱上的人和\n一个人 他给我们的日常生活带来欢乐和幸福， 因为如果我们\n要 …和 一个人共度余生，最好是我们\n真正想每天见到的人，所以为什么 美国女孩不想和一个人一起度过余生呢？ 结婚\n有两个主要原因，第一个 是在这里很难找到一个真正的\n好男人，很多美国 男人不做任何家务，\n他们不擅长照顾 孩子，而且他们 可能非常\n自私，所以对于女孩来说，结婚后 她们应该继续做\n自己的全职工作，照顾 房子，照顾孩子，\n所以我可以根据我妈妈这样做的经验告诉你\n中文 …里 有这样一个\n短语，我想很多人认为 美国不是这样的，但在大多数\n地方我会说确实如此， 女孩应该比男孩做更多的事情，\n例如我有 三个兄弟 ，我是唯一的女儿，所以我被\n期望比他们做更多的事情， 在我 10 岁之前，我就可以\n干净地做饭，洗碗，割草， 照顾房子，照顾\n我的弟弟 实际上， 房子周围需要做的任何事情\n我都可以做，而且人们期望我 做，但即使到了今天，我\n什至不认为我的一些兄弟知道 如何洗衣服，所以有\n很多事情 在美国文化中，这 对女性来说确实不公平，反过来这给\n我们带来了对 婚姻的负面印象，这让我们\n想到了美国女孩 不再真正想结婚的第二个原因，\n因为现在大多数女孩都 可以结婚。 过着非常充实和幸福的生活，\n完全独立，越来越多的 女性接受了更好的教育，\n这使她们能够找到更高薪的工作， 并能够完全养活\n自己。过去，女孩被 期望结婚生子，\n只是像一个女人一样生活。 家庭主妇，如果你 不这样做，这基本上是社会\n不可接受的，你可能会被 社会排斥，但现在我想说，\n我认识的大多数女孩都 过着完全独立的幸福生活\n，她们有一个很好的群体 朋友和家人\n在她们学习或工作的同时支持 她们养活自己结婚绝对\n不是她们一生的主要焦点 我认为女孩\n能够有这样的选择来选择 她们想要的未来是非常重要的\n虽然 …大多数 美国人可能并不是真的想\n结婚，但仍然有 很多美国人确实结婚了，\n特别是如果你去 美国的一些小城镇，那里的\n生活成本要低得多，人们可以结婚。 拥有 更轻松的生活方式，你\n会看到越来越多的人 结婚生子，因为他们\n不需要工作太多，或者 如果他们有一份非常好的工作，他们可以依靠一个人的收入，\n所以在这些情况下 有一些女性是家庭主妇\n，这个词并没有真正的负面含义， 除非你说得像\n她只是一个家庭主妇那样，那么它可能会 显得非常具有评判性，大多数美国人\n在有人说 自己是家庭主妇或家庭主妇时并不会真正做出评判。 保持原子妈妈\n或类似的东西，因为我们知道 照顾 …整个\n房子并基本上独自抚养孩子是多么困难， 有些人可能会感到嫉妒，\n或者他们可能会觉得那些女人 没有充分发挥自己的作用\n作为一名家庭主妇就有潜力，但 那些挑剔的人实际上只是\n少数，所以即使最近很多 美国女孩选择不\n结婚，我想说， 我们很多人内心深处仍然想\n结婚，但这真的很难 找到 合适的人，我认为只要我们有合适的人，婚姻就应该\n非常简单，容易，而且非常 浪漫 …，\n但如果没有那个人， 我认为这只会让\n很多女性的生活变得更加困难，无论如何，我 希望这个视频对您有帮助 了解\n更多关于美国文化的信息， 如果您有任何\n类似的想法或感受，或者 有任何疑问，请在评论中告诉我，\n我们下次再见，再见")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
