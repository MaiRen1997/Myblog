房子前面\n有很多乐趣、音乐、\n"庆祝活动和游戏\n。"\n"于是我跑到后院\n寻找更多的乐趣。"\n我偶然发现的事情让我震惊。\n"人们\n在生日宴会上宰杀受惊的动物。"\n这是一种奇怪的感觉。\n作为一个 12 岁的孩子，\n"看到后面的剧烈痛苦\n和前面的纯粹欢乐，将"\n"生日\n与死亡日放在"\n"同一时刻，\n实在让人难以承受。"\n12岁的我泪流满面。\n"我知道这\n对你们许多人（"\n或许还有你们的许多孩子）来说是一种常见的经历。\n我们都在某种程度上知道，\n我们今天吃的肉\n背后有一个非常令人不安的故事。\n"我们知道，数十亿动物\n是在痛苦、"\n过度拥挤的条件下饲养的，\n"而不是在我们愿意相信的田园诗般的牧场上饲养的\n。"\n我们知道气候变化是造成的——\n"事实上，其主要原因\n是肉类生产。"\n我们还知道，工厂化养殖\n"是导致\n极其可怕的疾病传播"\n"以及\n抗生素耐药性不断上升的原因。"\n"但尽管如此，\n你可能会继续吃肉。"\n"事实上，\n"\n"本世纪上半叶世界的肉类消费量将是本世纪初的两倍\n。"\n那么尽管如此，\n为什么呢？\n为什么是这个问题。\n我们真的有解决办法吗？\n我不肯定。\n"但我会告诉你为什么\n这是一个复杂的问题，"\n"因为肉是我们已经习惯的最\n美味的食物"\n。\n没有对沙拉或豆类的不尊重。 数百年甚至数千年以来，\n"它一直是我们文化、\n传统和宗教的一部分"\n。\n"我们喜欢的是产品，而\n不是过程。"\n"因此，我们学会了\n通过视而不见来忽视冲突。"\n"我认为这是\n一个有冲突的食肉动物要处理的核心冲突。"\n"那么，\n对于一个矛盾的食肉动物来说，有没有出路呢？"\n我相信有。\n事实上，我正在打赌。\n"大约八年前，\n我辞去了心脏病专家的工作，"\n举家搬到全国各地，\n"组建了一个专门\n致力于解决这个问题的团队。"\n我与他人共同创立了一家名为 UPSIDE Foods 的公司，\n"致力于研究一个\n名为“人造肉”的疯狂想法。"\n"它基于一个简单的原理：\n我们吃的所有肉都"\n来自一堆动物细胞。\n所以我们提出了一个问题，\n"我们是否可以直接将动物细胞培养\n成肉"\n而不需要饲养动物？ 事实\n证明，\n"这个想法几十年来一直根植\n于科幻小说中"\n。\n我想向您展示\n"并说明\n我们如何用鸡肉做到这一点。"\n"那么，让我们从先有\n鸡还是先有蛋开始吧。"\n"我们所做的就是\n从鸡蛋或鸡肉中提取少量细胞样本，"\n"然后识别出高质量的细胞，\n"\n"并在\n动物体外继续生长成鸡肉。"\n一旦我们拥有了合适的细胞，\n我们就会将它们保存起来供以后使用，\n或者当我们想要制作鸡肉时，\n我们将它们取出到一个小样本中，\n"就像\n适合装入这样的小瓶中的样本一样。"\n在这个小瓶中，\n您可能会看到数百万个细胞，\n"就像\n您在幻灯片上看到的那样。"\n现在请记住，鸡的生命\n始于一个细胞，\n"然后生长并繁殖\n成数百万个细胞。"\n"所以我们将这些细胞\n放入培养器中。"\n你可能会问，什么是修炼者？\n培养器只不过是一个干净的容器，为细胞生长成鸡肉\n提供安全、培育\n"和温暖的环境\n。"\n"它们的尺寸可以很小，\n比如水瓶大小，"\n"也可以高达\n一到两层楼，"\n"钢制、干净、闪闪发光的水箱，\n就像你在我身后看到的那样。"\n"一旦我们将这种肉种植了\n大约两周，"\n我们就可以收获它\n"并将其塑造成\n我们喜欢的产品。"\n整切产品或切割产品。\n"通常将\n其中一些产品"\n与植物纤维混合以增加质感。\n"这可以\n用牛肉、鲑鱼、鸭肉"\n或任何你能想象到的物种来完成。\n一旦我们获得了我们想要的细胞，\n我们就不必再回到动物身上。\n"事实上，我们\n用来培育鸡的细胞是"\n在 2018 年从鸡蛋中取出的，\n"六年来我们不必\n再次回到动物身上。"\n这是一种更友善的肉类制作方式，\n而且对环境也更友善。 例如，\n"多项研究\n表明，"\n对于使用可再生能源进行大规模种植的养殖牛肉而言，\n"\n温室气体排放量可减少 90%，"\n"土地使用量可减少 90%，\n污染也可减少。"\n"\n由于没有动物粪便"\n"或需要使用\n增加感染风险的抗生素（"\n无论是大肠杆菌还是沙门氏菌），它也更清洁。\n"我们可以拥有真正清洁的\n制造条件。"\n"现在，我想你肯定认为\n这肯定是科幻小说，"\n这太疯狂了，\n"但八年前，\n当我创办 UPSIDE Foods 时，"\n"很多人\n嘲笑我和我们的团队。"\n"让我向您展示\n过去八年中所发生的快速进展。"\n"2016 年，我们向世界展示了\n第一个人工培育的牛肉丸，"\n并于 2017 年向世界\n"展示了第一个人\n工培育的鸭子或鸡肉。"\n这证明是科学的。\n"这是多年来多个物种的科学证明\n。"\n下一个是什么？\n"接下来最重要的\n是证明安全。"\n"我们开始与\n美国两大监管机构"\nFDA 和 USDA 合作，\n经过多年的合作，在对\n"\n我们的流程进行彻底检查后，不到一年前，"\n"我们获得了将\n产品投放市场的许可"\n，  2023 年 7 月。\n我必须告诉你，\n下一部分是消费者。\n你可能会问，味道怎么样？\n这些人，无论是\n"铁杆肉食者\n还是素食者，他们的面孔"\n"都会告诉你\n这是美味的故事。"\n"事实上，我们最喜欢的一句话\n来自《华盛顿邮报》，"\n"詹姆斯·比尔德\n奖获奖作家在其中写道，"\n"“这是\n他很长一段时间以来尝过的最鸡肉的鸡肉”。"\n好了，说到美味，\n"我们这里的厨师一直在忙着\n做一些"\n我想给大家展示的产品。\n"让我展示或说明\n这如何在你的生活中发挥作用。"\n想象一下一周。\n从周日开始，\n您的孩子希望您做早餐。\n"他们最喜欢的早餐\n是早餐香肠。"\n让我向您展示这会是什么样子。\n谢谢。 大卫。\n"好的，例如，有一种培植\n鸡肉早餐香肠。"\n很好吃，多汁。\n我现在就想吃它。\n但还有更多。\n我想让你想想星期三。\n您正在出差，\n想要快速享用一顿营养丰富的午餐。\n想象一下这个。\n富含蛋白质的鸡肉沙拉，上面\n"有美味的\n金棕色鸡肉。"\n而且我也想吃这个。\n但还有更多。\n（笑声）\n"现在是周五，\n周末，感谢上帝。"\n"您想\n与您的伴侣共进一顿真正轻松浪漫的晚餐。"\n如果你想给你的伴侣留下深刻的印象，\n"可以带你的伴侣\n去离你最近的餐厅，"\n并要求菜单上最好的东西，\n这表明你是一个多么伟大的人。\n（笑声）\n我们也为你准备了这个。\n谢谢你，大卫。\n这就是美味的鸡胸肉，\n鲜嫩多汁，\n在你面前煮熟，\n在盘子上滋滋作响。\n你的伴侣也咬了一口。\n并说：\n“嗯。”\n（笑声）\n“我吃过的最鸡的鸡。”\n（笑声）\n好吧，那么接下来会发生什么呢？\n这个行业正在迅速增长。\n"我真的很高兴看到除南极洲外每个大陆都有\n大约 170 家该领域的公司"\n。\n"多个研究组织，\n例如 Good Food Institute，"\n正在致力于提供这一服务\n"并在大学建立培训项目\n。"\n"我们已经获得多个国家/地区的\n监管批准："\n"美国、新加坡、以色列，\n澳大利亚也即将获得批准。"\n"我们已经投入了三十亿美元\n。"\n听说，\n"韩国刚刚启动了\n一个自由经济区，"\n"以鼓励培育肉类\n迅速商业化，"\n"而中国已将其添加\n到他们的五年计划中。 世界各地"\n"有许多公司\n"\n"准备将美味的\n产品推向市场。"\n看看这个。\n它们可以是全切产品，\n可以是牛排，也\n"可以是\n热狗、汉堡或寿司等深受喜爱的食物。"\n各位，这是一场全球性的竞赛，\n"历史上从未有过\n如此规模的想法在不到十年的时间内"\n"从一个想法阶段转变为如此\n受关注的水平"\n。\n那么接下来会发生什么呢？\n下一步是规模证明。\n"我们必须努力，看看\n这个行业是否能够扩大规模，"\n"以满足\n我们正在努力解决的问题的规模。"\n"这意味着我们必须建造\n更大、更大、"\n"更高效的制造\n设施和供应链。"\n"我们已经将\n成本降低了 100 倍，"\n"但世界各地的团队\n正在不懈努力，"\n以进一步降低成本。\n"这是\n我们在新"\n冠疫情期间在加利福尼亚州建造的生产设施的一个例子，\n在过去的 12 到 18 个月里，我们一直在定期生产人造肉，\n并改进运营和设计，\n"使其成为更大\n生产设施的蓝图。"\n"我们已将所有这些内容公开发布\n给全世界。"\n"我认为\n需要越来越多的这样的事情。"\n那么还存在哪些其他挑战呢？\n时间表很难预测。\n监管部门的批准很难预测，\n"但我相信未来几年内多家公司\n将在餐馆"\n"提供其产品\n，"\n然后在未来五到十年内，\n"这些产品应该\n在零售业广泛使用。"\n"继续进一步降低成本\n并不容易。"\n"制作\n肉不仅不那么糟糕，而且还存在一些障碍，"\n"但我真的很高兴\n能够走上"\n制作更好的肉的道路。\n例如，作为一名心脏病专家，\n"没有什么\n比开辟肉类"\n变得更美味、更健康的道路更让我兴奋的了。\n"想象一下，牛排\n的营养成分与鲑鱼一样。"\n"我认为这就是\n我感到非常兴奋的未来。"\n"但我们的挑战不仅仅是\n技术或制造挑战"\n或资金挑战。\n"还有社会\n和政治挑战。"\n"佛罗里达州上个月刚刚禁止\n养殖肉类生产并将其定为犯罪。"\n"阿拉巴马州\n将于今年 10 月开始实施，"\n意大利则于今年早些时候实施。\n"所有这些都是为了保护\n这个古老的行业免受竞争。"\n但我坚信，\n"这些地方的人民、企业和社区以及世界其他地区都\n将受益于人造肉"\n。\n所以这不是理想主义的幻想。\n纵观历史，\n"变革性创新\n总是战胜"\n"根深蒂固的根深蒂固的反对派，\n使社会变得更好。"\n这没什么不同。\n"\n舞台上人们不屈不挠的精神"\n"将成为\n推动这一创新的基础。"\n但我们不能单独做到这一点。\n我们需要很多人、啦啦队员、\n"跨越党派界限的政客、\n民众、企业、"\n"投资者和现有行业\n加入这项工作。"\n"因为投资像人造肉\n这样的关键理念"\n，让未来我们可以\n"吃到\n我们喜爱的所有食物，"\n并开启巨大的经济、\n道德和环境机会，\n就在我们面前。\n我留给你们一个最后的想法。\n"我坚信，人造肉\n提供了这个难得的机会，"\n"可以将各种类型的人们\n聚集在大帐篷下，"\n那些热爱肉类的人和\n"那些反对\n屠宰动物的人。"\n那些珍视创新的人和\n那些珍视传统的人。\n热爱选择的人，\n珍视生命的人。\n如果你能原谅这个笑话的话，我们\n就有机会吃我们的鸡了。\n（笑声）\n非常感谢。\n（掌声）')])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);n.default=a.exports}}]);
